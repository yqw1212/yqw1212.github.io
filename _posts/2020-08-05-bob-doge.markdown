正常的许可证内容，并没有flag的线索。

那就安装这个程序试试。选择安装位置，得到一个exe文件。

运行文件

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2020-08-05-open.jpg)

点击decode按钮

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/2020-08-05-decode.jpg)

显然程序中图片上方的乱码应该是被加密后的flag。

dnSpy打开文件分析代码

```assembly
private void btnDecode_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.pbRoge.Image = Resources.bob_roge;
    byte[] dat_secret = Resources.dat_secret;
    string text = "";
    foreach (byte b in dat_secret)
    {
    	text += (char)((b >> 4 | ((int)b << 4 & 240)) ^ 41);
    }
    text += "\0";
    string text2 = "";
    for (int j = 0; j < text.Length; j += 2)
    {
    	text2 += text[j + 1];
    	text2 += text[j];
    }
    string text3 = "";
    for (int k = 0; k < text2.Length; k++)
    {
    	char c = text2[k];
    	text3 += (char)((byte)text2[k] ^ 102);
    }
    this.lbl_title.Text = text3;
}
```

但是由于被加密后的字符串不能复制，所以我们并不能通过逆向来取得flag。

所以我们通过加断点调试程序来直接取得text的值。

```assembly
text = "3rmahg3rd.b0b.d0ge@flare-on.com\0"
```

得到flag

```assembly
flag{3rmahg3rd.b0b.d0ge@flare-on.com}
```
