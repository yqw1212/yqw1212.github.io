is angr, and how do I use it?\nangr is a multi-architecture binary analysis toolkit, with the capability to perform dynamic symbolic execution (like Mayhem, KLEE, etc.) and various static analyses on binaries. If you'd like to learn how to use it, you're in the right place!\nWe've tried to make using angr as pain-free as possible - our goal is to create a user-friendly binary analysis suite, allowing a user to simply start up iPython and easily perform intensive binary analyses with a couple of commands. That being said, binary analysis is complex, which makes angr complex. This documentation is an attempt to help out with that, providing narrative explanation and exploration of angr and its design.\nSeveral challenges must be overcome to programmatically analyze a binary. They are, roughly:\n\nLoading a binary into the analysis program.\nTranslating a binary into an intermediate representation (IR).\nPerforming the actual analysis. This could be:\nA partial or full-program static analysis (i.e., dependency analysis, program slicing).\nA symbolic exploration of the program's state space (i.e., \"Can we execute it until we find an overflow?\").\nSome combination of the above (i.e., \"Let's execute only program slices that lead to a memory write, to find an overflow.\")\n\n\n\nangr has components that meet all of these challenges. This book will explain how each one works, and how they can all be used to accomplish your evil goals.\nGet Started\nInstallation instructions can be found here.\nTo dive right into angr's capabilities, start with the top level methods and read forward from there.\nA searchable HTML version of this documentation is hosted at docs.angr.io, and an HTML API reference can be found at angr.io/api-doc.\nIf you enjoy playing CTFs and would like to learn angr in a similar fashion, angr_ctf will be a fun way for you to get familiar with much of the symbolic execution capability of angr.

It is built for Python 3: Python 2 support is not feasible due to the looming EOL and the small size of our team.\nWe highly recommend using a python virtual environment to install and use angr. Several of angr's dependencies (z3, pyvex) require libraries of native code that are forked from their originals, and if you already have libz3 or libVEX installed, you definitely don't want to overwrite the official shared objects with ours. In general, don't expect support for problems arising from installing angr outside of a virtualenv.\nDependencies\nAll of the python dependencies should be handled by pip and/or the setup.py scripts. You will, however, need to build some C to get from here to the end, so you'll need a good build environment as well as the python development headers. At some point in the dependency install process, you'll install the python library cffi, but (on linux, at least) it won't run unless you install your operating system's libffi package.\nOn Ubuntu, you will want: sudo apt-get install python3-dev libffi-dev build-essential virtualenvwrapper. If you are trying out angr Management, you will also need the PySide 2 requirements.\nMost Operating systems, all *nix systems\nmkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3) angr && pip install angr should usually be sufficient to install angr in most cases, since angr is published on the Python Package Index.\nFish (shell) users can either use virtualfish or the virtualenv package: vf new angr && vf activate angr && pip install angr\nFailing that, you can install angr by installing the following repositories, in order, from https://github.com/angr:\n\narchinfo\npyvex\nclaripy\ncle\nangr\n\nMac OS X\npip install angr should work, but there are some caveats.\nangr requires the unicorn library, which (as of this writing) pip must build from source on macOS, even though binary distributions (\"wheels\") exist on other platforms. Building unicorn from source requires Python 2, so will fail inside a virtualenv where python gets you Python 3. If you encounter errors with pip install angr, you may need to first install unicorn separately, pointing it to your Python 2:\nUNICORN_QEMU_FLAGS=\"--python=/path/to/python2\" pip install unicorn  # Python 2 is probably /usr/bin/python on your macOS system\n\nThen retry pip install angr.\nIf this still doesn't work and you run into a broken build script with Clang, try using GCC.\nbrew install gcc\nCC=/usr/local/bin/gcc-8 UNICORN_QEMU_FLAGS=\"--python=/path/to/python2\" pip install unicorn  # As of this writing, brew install gcc gives you gcc-8\npip install angr\n\nAfter installing angr, you will need to fix some shared library paths for the angr native libraries.\nActivate your virtual env and execute the following lines. A script is provided in the angr-dev repo.\nPYVEX=`python3 -c 'import pyvex; print(pyvex.__path__[0])'`\nUNICORN=`python3 -c 'import unicorn; print(unicorn.__path__[0])'`\nANGR=`python3 -c 'import angr; print(angr.__path__[0])'`\n\ninstall_name_tool -change libunicorn.1.dylib \"$UNICORN\"/lib/libunicorn.dylib \"$ANGR\"/lib/angr_native.dylib\ninstall_name_tool -change libpyvex.dylib \"$PYVEX\"/lib/libpyvex.dylib \"$ANGR\"/lib/angr_native.dylib\n\nWindows\nAs usual, a virtualenv is very strongly recommended. You can use either the virtualenv-win or virtualenv packages for this.\nangr can be installed from pip on Windows, same as above: pip install angr.\nYou should not be required to build any C code with this setup, since wheels (binary distributions) should be automatically pulled down for angr and its dependencies.\nNix/NixOS\nangr is available via the Nix package manager and on NixOS, using the Nix User Repository.\nFirst, make NUR available to your user:\ncat  ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix\n{\n  packageOverrides = pkgs: {\n    nur = import (builtins.fetchTarball \"https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/master.tar.gz\") {\n      inherit pkgs;\n    };\n  };\n}\n__EOF__\n\nThen, to obtain a nix-shell with the angr Python package:\nnix-shell -p 'python3.withPackages(ps: with ps; [ nur.repos.angr.python3Packages.angr ])'\n\nMore information on angr/nixpkgs.\nDevelopment install\nThere is a special repository angr-dev with scripts to make life easier for angr developers.\nYou can set up angr in development mode by running:\ngit clone https://github.com/angr/angr-dev\ncd angr-dev\n./setup.sh -i -e angr\n\nThis creates a virtualenv (-e angr), checks for any dependencies you might need (-i), clones all of the repositories and installs them in editable mode.\nsetup.sh can even create a PyPy virtualenv for you (replace -e with -p), resulting in significantly faster performance and lower memory usage.\nYou can branch/edit/recompile the various modules in-place, and it will automatically reflect in your virtual environment.\nDevelopment install on windows\nThe angr-dev repository has a setup.bat script that creates the same setup as above, though it's not as magical as setup.sh.\nSince we'll be building C code, you must be in the visual studio developer command prompt.\nMake sure that if you're using a 64-bit python interpreter, you're also using the 64-bit build tools (VsDevCmd.bat -arch=x64)\npip install virtualenv\ngit clone https://github.com/angr/angr-dev\ncd angr-dev\nvirtualenv -p \"C:\\Path\\To\\python3\\python.exe\" env\nenv\\Scripts\\activate\nsetup.bat\n\nYou may also substitute the use of virtualenv above with the virtualenvwrapper-win package for a more streamlined experience.\nDocker install\nFor convenience, we ship a Docker image that is 99% guaranteed to work.\nYou can install via docker by doing:\n# install docker\ncurl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sudo sh\n\n# pull the docker image\nsudo docker pull angr/angr\n\n# run it\nsudo docker run -it angr/angr\n\nSynchronization of files in and out of docker is left as an exercise to the user (hint: check out docker run -v).\nModifying the angr container\nYou might find yourself needing to install additional packages via apt. The vanilla version of the container does not have the sudo package installed, which means the default user in the container cannot escalate privilege to install additional packages. \nTo over come this hurdle, use the following docker command to grant yourself root access:\n# assuming the docker container is running \n# with the name \"angr\" and the instance is\n# running in the background.\ndocker exec -ti -u root angr bash\n\nTroubleshooting\nlibgomp.so.1: version GOMP_4.0 not found, or other z3 issues\nThis specific error represents an incompatibility between the pre-compiled version of libz3.so and the installed version of libgomp. A Z3 recompile is required. You can do this by executing:\npip install -I --no-binary z3-solver z3-solver\n\nNo such file or directory: 'pyvex_c'\nAre you running Ubuntu 12.04? If so, please stop using a 6 year old operating system! Upgrading is free!\nYou can also try upgrading pip (python -m pip install -U pip), which might solve the issue.\nAttributeError: 'FFI' object has no attribute 'unpack'\nYou have an outdated version of the cffi Python module.  angr now requires at least version 1.7 of cffi.\nTry pip install --upgrade cffi.  If the problem persists, make sure your operating system hasn't pre-installed an old version of cffi, which pip may refuse to uninstall.\nIf you're using a Python virtual environment with the pypy interpreter, ensure you have a recent version of pypy, as it includes a version of cffi which pip will not upgrade.\nangr has no attribute Project, or similar\nIf you can import angr but it doesn't seem to be the actual angr module... did you accidentally name your script angr.py?\nYou can't do that. Python does not work that way.\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'KS_ARCH_X86'\nYou have the keystone package installed, which conflicts with the keystone-engine package (an optional dependency of angr).\nPlease uninstall keystone.\nIf you would like to install keystone-engine, please do it with pip install --no-binary keystone-engine keystone-engine, as the current pip distribution is broken.\nNo such file or directory: 'libunicorn.dylib'\n(alternate error message: Cannot use 'python', Python 2.4 or later is required. Note that Python 3 or later is not yet supported.)\nYou need to define the UNICORN_QEMU_FLAGS environment variable for pip. See the section above on installing for macOS.\npthread check failed: Make sure to have the pthread libs and headers installed.\n(macOS) Try using GCC instead of Clang; see the section above on installing for macOS.\n"},"HACKING.html":{"url":"HACKING.html","title":"How to Contribute","keywords":"","body":"Reporting Bugs\nIf you've found something that angr isn't able to solve and appears to be a bug, please let us know!\n\nCreate a fork off of angr/binaries and angr/angr\nGive us a pull request with angr/binaries, with the binaries in question\nGive us a pull request for angr/angr, with testcases that trigger the binaries in angr/tests/broken_x.py, angr/tests/broken_y.py, etc\n\nPlease try to follow the testcase format that we have (so the code is in a test_blah function), that way we can very easily merge that and make the scripts run.An example is:\ndef test_some_broken_feature():\n    p = angr.Project(\"some_binary\")\n    result = p.analyses.SomethingThatDoesNotWork()\n    assert result == \"what it should *actually* be if it worked\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_some_broken_feature()\n\nThis will greatly help us recreate your bug and fix it faster.The ideal situation is that, when the bug is fixed, your testcases passes (i.e., the assert at the end does not raise an AssertionError).Then, we can just fix the bug and rename broken_x.py to test_x.py and the testcase will run in our internal CI at every push, ensuring that we do not break this feature again.\nDeveloping angr\nThese are some guidelines so that we can keep the codebase in good shape!\nCoding style\nWe try to get as close as the PEP8 code convention as is reasonable without being dumb. If you use Vim, the python-mode plugin does all you need. You can also manually configure vim to adopt this behavior.\nMost importantly, please consider the following when writing code as part of angr:\n\nTry to use attribute access (see the @property decorator) instead of getters and setters wherever you can. This isn't Java, and attributes enable tab completion in iPython. That being said, be reasonable: attributes should be fast. A rule of thumb is that if something could require a constraint solve, it should not be an attribute.\n\nUse our .pylintrc from the angr-dev repo. It's fairly permissive, but our CI server will fail your builds if pylint complains under those settings.\n\nDO NOT, under ANY circumstances, raise Exception or assert False. Use the right exception type. If there isn't a correct exception type, subclass the core exception of the module that you're working in (i.e., AngrError in angr, SimError in SimuVEX, etc) and raise that. We catch, and properly handle, the right types of errors in the right places, but AssertionError and Exception are not handled anywhere and force-terminate analyses.\n\nAvoid tabs; use space indentation instead. Even though it's wrong, the de facto standard is 4 spaces. It is a good idea to adopt this from the beginning, as merging code that mixes both tab and space indentation is awful.\n\nAvoid super long lines. It's okay to have longer lines, but keep in mind that long lines are harder to read and should be avoided. Let's try to stick to 120 characters.\n\nAvoid extremely long functions, it is often better to break them up into smaller functions.\n\nAlways use _ instead of __ for private members (so that we can access them when debugging). You might not think that anyone has a need to call a given function, but trust us, you're wrong.\n\n\nDocumentation\nDocument your code. Every class definition and public function definition should have some description of:\n\nWhat it does.\nWhat are the type and the meaning of the parameters.\nWhat it returns.\n\nClass docstrings will be enforced by our linter.\nDo not under any circumstances write a docstring which doesn't provide more information than the name of the class.\nWhat you should try to write is a description of the environment that the class should be used in.\nIf the class should not be instantiated by end-users, write a description of where it will be generated and how instances can be acquired.\nIf the class should be instanciated by end-users, explain what kind of object it represents at its core, what behavior is expected of its parameters, and how to safely manage objects of its type.\nWe use Sphinx to generate the API documentation. Sphinx supports docstrings written in ReStructured Text with special keywords to document function and class parameters, return values, return types, members, etc.\nHere is an example of function documentation. Ideally the parameter descriptions should be aligned vertically to make the docstrings as readable as possible.\ndef prune(self, filter_func=None, from_stash=None, to_stash=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prune unsatisfiable paths from a stash.\n\n    :param filter_func: Only prune paths that match this filter.\n    :param from_stash:  Prune paths from this stash. (default: 'active')\n    :param to_stash:    Put pruned paths in this stash. (default: 'pruned')\n    :returns:           The resulting PathGroup.\n    :rtype:             PathGroup\n    \"\"\"\n\nThis format has the advantage that the function parameters are clearly identified in the generated documentation. However, it can make the documentation repetitive, in some cases a textual description can be more readable. Pick the format you feel is more appropriate for the functions or classes you are documenting.\n def read_bytes(self, addr, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Read `n` bytes at address `addr` in memory and return an array of bytes.\n    \"\"\"\n\nUnit tests\nIf you're pushing a new feature and it is not accompanied by a test case it will be broken in very short order. Please write test cases for your stuff.\nWe have an internal CI server to run tests to check functionality and regression on each commit. In order to have our server run your tests, write your tests in a format acceptable to nosetests in a file matching test_*.py in the tests folder of the appropriate repository. A test file can contain any number of functions of the form def test_*(): or classes of the form class Test*(unittest.TestCase):. Each of them will be run as a test, and if they raise any exceptions or assertions, the test fails. Do not use the nose.tools.assert_* functions, as we are presently trying to migrate to nose2. Use assert statements with descriptive messages or the unittest.TestCase assert methods.\nLook at the existing tests for examples. Many of them use an alternate format where the test_* function is actually a generator that yields tuples of functions to call and their arguments, for easy parametrization of tests. \nFinally, do not add docstrings to your test functions.\n"},"HELPWANTED.html":{"url":"HELPWANTED.html","title":"What to Contribute","keywords":"","body":"\"Help Wanted\"\nangr is a huge project, and it's hard to keep up.\nHere, we list some big TODO items that we would love community contributions for in the hope that it can direct community involvement.\nThey (will) have a wide range of complexity, and there should be something for all skill levels!\nWe tag issues on our github repositories that would be good for community involvement as \"Help wanted\".\nTo see the exhaustive list of these, use this github search!\nDocumentation\nThere are many parts of angr that suffer from little or no documentation.\nWe desperately need community help in this area.\nAPI\nWe are always behind on documentation.\nWe've created several tracking issues on github to understand what's still missing:\n\nangr\nclaripy\ncle\npyvex\n\nGitBook\nThis book is missing some core areas.\nSpecifically, the following could be improved:\n\nFinish some of the TODOs floating around the book.\nOrganize the Examples page in some way that makes sense. Right now, most of the examples are very redundant. It might be cool to have a simple table of most of them so that the page is not so overwhelming.\n\nangr course\nDeveloping a \"course\" of sorts to get people started with angr would be really beneficial.\nSteps have already been made in this direction here, but more expansion would be beneficial.\nIdeally, the course would have a hands-on component, of increasing difficulty, that would require people to use more and more of angr's capabilities.\nResearch re-implementation\nUnfortunately, not everyone bases their research on angr ;-).\nUntil that's remedied, we'll need to periodically implement related work, on top of angr, to make it reusable within the scope of the framework.\nThis section lists some of this related work that's ripe for reimplementation in angr.\nRedundant State Detection for Dynamic Symbolic Execution\nBugrara, et al. describe a method to identify and trim redundant states, increasing the speed of symbolic execution by up to 50 times and coverage by 4%.\nThis would be great to have in angr, as an ExplorationTechnique.\nThe paper is here: http://nsl.cs.columbia.edu/projects/minestrone/papers/atc13-bugrara.pdf\nIn-Vivo Multi-Path Analysis of Software Systems\nRather than developing symbolic summaries for every system call, we can use a technique proposed by S2E for concretizing necessary data and dispatching them to the OS itself.\nThis would make angr applicable to a much larger set of binaries than it can currently analyze.\nWhile this would be most useful for system calls, once it is implemented, it could be trivially applied to any location of code (i.e., library functions).\nBy carefully choosing which library functions are handled like this, we can greatly increase angr's scalability.\nDevelopment\nWe have several projects in mind that primarily require development effort.\nangr-management\nThe angr GUI, angr-management needs a lot of work.\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of what is currently missing in angr-management:\n\nA navigator toolbar showing content in a program’s memory space, just like IDA Pro’s navigator toolbar.\nA text-based disassembly view of the program.\nBetter view showing details in program states during path exploration, including modifiable register view, memory view, file descriptor view, etc.\nA GUI for cross referencing.\n\nExposing angr's capabilities in a usable way, graphically, would be really useful!\nIDA Plugins\nMuch of angr's functionality could be exposed via IDA.\nFor example, angr's data dependence graph could be exposed in IDA through annotations, or obfuscated values can be resolved using symbolic execution.\nAdditional architectures\nMore architecture support would make angr all the more useful.\nSupporting a new architecture with angr would involve:\n\nAdding the architecture information to archinfo\nAdding an IR translation. This may be either an extension to PyVEX, producing IRSBs, or another IR entirely.\nIf your IR is not VEX, add a SimEngine to support it.\nAdding a calling convention (angr.SimCC) to support SimProcedures (including system calls)\nAdding or modifying an angr.SimOS to support initialization activities.\nCreating a CLE backend to load binaries, or extending the CLE ELF backend to know about the new architecture if the binary format is ELF.\n\nideas for new architectures:\n\nPIC, AVR, other embedded architectures\nSPARC (there is some preliminary libVEX support for SPARC here)\n\nideas for new IRs:\n\nLLVM IR (with this, we can extend angr from just a Binary Analysis Framework to a Program Analysis Framework and expand its capabilities in other ways!)\nSOOT (there is no reason that angr can't analyze Java code, although doing so would require some extensions to our memory model)\n\nEnvironment support\nWe use the concept of \"function summaries\" in angr to model the environment of operating systems (i.e., the effects of their system calls) and library functions. Extending this would be greatly helpful in increasing angr's utility.\nThese function summaries can be found here.\nA specific subset of this is system calls. Even more than library function SimProcedures (without which angr can always execute the actual function), we have very few workarounds for missing system calls.\nEvery implemented system call extends the set of binaries that angr can handle.\nDesign Problems\nThere are some outstanding design challenges regarding the integration of additional functionalities into angr.\nType annotation and type information usage\nangr has fledgling support for types, in the sense that it can parse them out of header files. However, those types are not well exposed to do anything useful with. Improving this support would make it possible to, for example, annotate certain memory regions with certain type information and interact with them intelligently.\nConsider, for example, interacting with a linked list like this: print state.mem[state.regs.rax].llist.next.next.value.\n(editor's note: you can actually already do this)\nResearch Challenges\nHistorically, angr has progressed in the course of research into novel areas of program analysis.\nHere, we list several self-contained research projects that can be tackled.\nSemantic function identification/diffing\nCurrent function diffing techniques (TODO: some examples) have drawbacks.\nFor the CGC, we created a semantic-based binary identification engine (https://github.com/angr/identifier) that can identify functions based on testcases.\nThere are two areas of improvement, each of which is its own research project:\n\nCurrently, the testcases used by this component are human-generated. However, symbolic execution can be used to automatically generate testcases that can be used to recognize instances of a given function in other binaries.\nBy creating testcases that achieve a \"high-enough\" code coverage of a given function, we can detect changes in functionality by applying the set of testcases to another implementation of the same function and analyzing changes in code coverage. This can then be used as a sematic function diff.\n\nApplying AFL's path selection criteria to symbolic execution\nAFL does an excellent job in identifying \"unique\" paths during fuzzing by tracking the control flow transitions taken by every path.\nThis same metric can be applied to symbolic exploration, and would probably do a depressingly good job, considering how simple it is.\nOverarching Research Directions\nThere are areas of program analysis that are not well explored.\nWe list general directions of research here, but readers should keep in mind that these directions likely describe potential undertakings of entire PhD dissertations.\nProcess interactions\nAlmost all work in the field of binary analysis deals with single binaries, but this is often unrealistic in the real world.\nFor example, the type of input that can be passed to a CGI program depend on pre-processing by a web server.\nCurrently, there is no way to support the analysis of multiple concurrent processes in angr, and many open questions in the field (i.e., how to model concurrent actions).\nIntra-process concurrency\nSimilar to the modeling of interactions between processes, little work has been done in understanding the interaction of concurrent threads in the same process.\nCurrently, angr has no way to reason about this, and it is unclear from the theoretical perspective how to approach this.\nA subset of this problem is the analysis of signal handlers (or hardware interrupts).\nEach signal handler can be modeled as a thread that can be executed at any time that a signal can be triggered.\nUnderstanding when it is meaningful to analyze these handlers is an open problem.\nOne system that does reason about the effect of interrupts is FIE.\nPath explosion\nMany approaches (such as Veritesting) attempt to mitigate the path explosion problem in symbolic execution.\nHowever, despite these efforts, path explosion is still the main problem preventing symbolic execution from being mainstream.\nangr provides an excellent base to implement new techniques to control path explosion.\nMost approaches can be easily implemented as Exploration Techniques and quickly evaluated (for example, on the CGC dataset).\n"},"docs/faq.html":{"url":"docs/faq.html","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","keywords":"","body":"Frequently Asked Questions\nThis is a collection of commonly-asked \"how do I do X?\" questions and other general questions about angr, for those too lazy to read this whole document.\nIf your question is of the form \"how do I fix X issue\", see also the Troubleshooting section of the install instructions.\nWhy is it named angr?\nThe core of angr's analysis is on VEX IR, and when something is vexing, it makes you angry.\nHow should \"angr\" be stylized?\nAll lowercase, even at the beginning of sentences. It's an anti-proper noun.\nHow can I get diagnostic information about what angr is doing?\nangr uses the standard logging module for logging, with every package and submodule creating a new logger.\nThe simplest way to get debug output is the following:\nimport logging\nlogging.getLogger('angr').setLevel('DEBUG')\n\nYou may want to use INFO or whatever else instead.\nBy default, angr will enable logging at the WARNING level.\nEach angr module has its own logger string, usually all the python modules above it in the hierarchy, plus itself, joined with dots.\nFor example, angr.analyses.cfg.\nBecause of the way the python logging module works, you can set the verbosity for all submodules in a module by setting a verbosity level for the parent module.\nFor example, logging.getLogger('angr.analyses').setLevel('INFO') will make the CFG, as well as all other analyses, log at the INFO level.\nWhy is angr so slow?\nIt's complicated!\nHow do I find bugs using angr?\nIt's complicated!\nThe easiest way to do this is to define a \"bug condition\", for example, \"the instruction pointer has become a symbolic variable\", and run symbolic exploration until you find a state matching that condition, then dump the input as a testcase.\nHowever, you will quickly run into the state explosion problem.\nHow you address this is up to you.\nYour solution may be as simple as adding an avoid condition or as complicated as implementing CMU's MAYHEM system as an Exploration Technique.\nWhy did you choose VEX instead of another IR (such as LLVM, REIL, BAP, etc)?\nWe had two design goals in angr that influenced this choice:\n\nangr needed to be able to analyze binaries from multiple architectures. This mandated the use of an IR to preserve our sanity, and required the IR to support many architectures.\nWe wanted to implement a binary analysis engine, not a binary lifter. Many projects start and end with the implementation of a lifter, which is a time consuming process. We needed to take something that existed and already supported the lifting of multiple architectures.\n\nSearching around the internet, the major choices were:\n\nLLVM is an obvious first candidate, but lifting binary code to LLVM cleanly is a pain. The two solutions are either lifting to LLVM through QEMU, which is hackish (and the only implementation of it seems very tightly integrated into S2E), or McSema, which only supported x86 at the time but has since gone through a rewrite and gotten support for x86-64 and aarch64.\nTCG is QEMU's IR, but extracting it seems very daunting as well and documentation is very scarse.\nREIL seems promising, but there is no standard reference implementation that supports all the architectures that we wanted. It seems like a nice academic work, but to use it, we would have to implement our own lifters, which we wanted to avoid.\nBAP was another possibility. When we started work on angr, BAP only supported lifting x86 code, and up-do-date versions of BAP were only available to academic collaborators of the BAP authors. These were two deal-breakers. BAP has since become open, but it still only supports x86_64, x86, and ARM.\nVEX was the only choice that offered an open library and support for many architectures. As a bonus, it is very well documented and designed specifically for program analysis, making it very easy to use in angr.\n\nWhile angr uses VEX now, there's no fundamental reason that multiple IRs cannot be used. There are two parts of angr, outside of the angr.engines.vex package, that are VEX-specific:\n\nthe jump labels (i.e., the Ijk_Ret for returns, Ijk_Call for calls, and so forth) are VEX enums.\nVEX treats registers as a memory space, and so does angr. While we provide accesses to state.regs.rax and friends, on the backend, this does state.registers.load(8, 8), where the first 8 is a VEX-defined offset for rax to the register file.\n\nTo support multiple IRs, we'll either want to abstract these things or translate their labels to VEX analogues.\nWhy are some ARM addresses off-by-one?\nIn order to encode THUMB-ness of an ARM code address, we set the lowest bit to one.\nThis convention comes from LibVEX, and is not entirely our choice!\nIf you see an odd ARM address, that just means the code at address - 1 is in THUMB mode.\nHow do I serialize angr objects?\nPickle will work.\nHowever, python will default to using an extremely old pickle protocol that does not support more complex python data structures, so you must specify a more advanced data stream format.\nThe easiest way to do this is pickle.dumps(obj, -1).\nWhat does UnsupportedIROpError(\"floating point support disabled\") mean?\nThis might crop up if you're using a CGC analysis such as driller or rex.\nFloating point support in angr has been disabled in the CGC analyses for a tight-knit nebula of reasons:\n\nLibvex's representation of floating point numbers is imprecise - it converts the 80-bit extended precision format used by the x87 for computation to 64-bit doubles, making it impossible to get precise results\nThere is very limited implementation support in angr for the actual primitive operations themselves as reported by libvex, so you will often get a less friendly \"unsupported operation\" error if you go too much further\nFor what operations are implemented, the basic optimizations that allow tractability during symbolic computation (AST deduplication, operation collapsing) are not implemented for floating point ops, leading to gigantic ASTs\nThere are memory corruption bugs in z3 that get triggered frighteningly easily when you're using huge workloads of mixed floating point and bitvector ops.\nWe haven't been able to get a testcase that doesn't involve \"just run angr\" for the z3 guys to investigate.\n\nInstead of trying to cope with all of these, we have simply disabled floating point support in the symbolic execution engine.\nTo allow for execution in the presence of floating point ops, we have enabled an exploration technique called the https://github.com/angr/angr/blob/master/angr/exploration_techniques/oppologist.py that is supposed to catch these issues, concretize their inputs, and run the problematic instructions through qemu via unicorn engine, allowing execution to continue.\nThe intuition is that the specific values of floating point operations don't typically affect the exploitation process.\nIf you're seeing this error and it's terminating the analysis, it's probably because you don't have unicorn installed or configured correctly.\nIf you're seeing this issue just in a log somewhere, it's just the oppologist kicking in and you have nothing to worry about.\nWhy is angr's CFG different from IDA's?\nTwo main reasons:\n\nIDA does not split basic blocks at function calls. angr will, because they are a form of control flow and basic blocks end at control flow instructions. You generally do not need the supergraph for performing automated analyses.\nIDA will split basic blocks if another block jumps into the middle of it. This is called basic block normalization, and angr does not do it by default since it is not necessary for most static analysis. You may enable it by passing normalize=True to the CFG analysis.\n\nWhy do I get incorrect register values when reading from a state during a SimInspect breakpoint?\nlibVEX will eliminate duplicate register writes within a single basic block when optimizations are enabled.\nTurn off IR optimization to make everything look right at all times.\nIn the case of the instruction pointer, libVEX will frequently omit mid-block writes even when optimizations are disabled.\nIn this case, you should use state.scratch.ins_addr to get the current instruction pointer.\n"},"docs/toplevel.html":{"url":"docs/toplevel.html","title":"Top Level Interfaces","keywords":"","body":"Before You Start\nUsing and exploring angr in IPython (or other Python command line interpreters) is a main use case that we design angr for.\nWhen you are not sure what interfaces are available, tab completion is your friend!\nSometimes tab completion in IPython can be slow.\nWe find the following workaround helpful without degrading the validity of completion results:\n# Drop this file in IPython profile's startup directory to avoid running it every time.\nimport IPython\npy = IPython.get_ipython()\npy.Completer.use_jedi = False\n\nCore Concepts\nBefore getting started with angr, you'll need to have a basic overview of some fundamental angr concepts and how to construct some basic angr objects.\nWe'll go over this by examining what's directly available to you after you've loaded a binary!\nYour first action with angr will always be to load a binary into a project.

Here's the main one!\n\n\n>>> proj.loader.main_object.execstack  # sample query: does this binary have an executable stack?\nFalse\n>>> proj.loader.main_object.pic  # sample query: is this binary position-independent?\nTrue\n\nThe factory\nThere are a lot of classes in angr, and most of them require a project to be instantiated. Instead of making you pass around the project everywhere, we provide project.factory, which has several convenient constructors for common objects you'll want to use frequently.\nThis section will also serve as an introduction to several basic angr concepts. Strap in!\nBlocks\nFirst, we have project.factory.block(), which is used to extract a basic block of code from a given address. This is an important fact - angr analyzes code in units of basic blocks. You will get back a Block object, which can tell you lots of fun things about the block of code:\n>>> block = proj.factory.block(proj.entry) # lift a block of code from the program's entry point\n\n\n>>> block.pp()                          # pretty-print a disassembly to stdout\n0x401670:       xor     ebp, ebp\n0x401672:       mov     r9, rdx\n0x401675:       pop     rsi\n0x401676:       mov     rdx, rsp\n0x401679:       and     rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0\n0x40167d:       push    rax\n0x40167e:       push    rsp\n0x40167f:       lea     r8, [rip + 0x2e2a]\n0x401686:       lea     rcx, [rip + 0x2db3]\n0x40168d:       lea     rdi, [rip - 0xd4]\n0x401694:       call    qword ptr [rip + 0x205866]\n\n>>> block.instructions                  # how many instructions are there?\n0xb\n>>> block.instruction_addrs             # what are the addresses of the instructions?\n[0x401670, 0x401672, 0x401675, 0x401676, 0x401679, 0x40167d, 0x40167e, 0x40167f, 0x401686, 0x40168d, 0x401694]\n\nAdditionally, you can use a Block object to get other representations of the block of code:\n>>> block.capstone                       # capstone disassembly\n\n>>> block.vex                            # VEX IRSB (that's a python internal address, not a program address)\n\n\nStates\nHere's another fact about angr - the Project object only represents an \"initialization image\" for the program. When you're performing execution with angr, you are working with a specific object representing a simulated program state - a SimState. Let's grab one right now!\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n\n\nA SimState contains a program's memory, registers, filesystem data... any \"live data\" that can be changed by execution has a home in the state. We'll cover how to interact with states in depth later, but for now, let's use state.regsand state.mem to access the registers and memory of this state:\n>>> state.regs.rip        # get the current instruction pointer\n\n>>> state.regs.rax\n\n>>> state.mem[proj.entry].int.resolved  # interpret the memory at the entry point as a C int\n\n\nThose aren't python ints! Those are bitvectors. Python integers don't have the same semantics as words on a CPU, e.g. wrapping on overflow, so we work with bitvectors, which you can think of as an integer as represented by a series of bits, to represent CPU data in angr. Note that each bitvector has a .length property describing how wide it is in bits.\nWe'll learn all about how to work with them soon, but for now, here's how to convert from python ints to bitvectors and back again:\n>>> bv = state.solver.BVV(0x1234, 32)       # create a 32-bit-wide bitvector with value 0x1234\n                               # BVV stands for bitvector value\n>>> state.solver.eval(bv)                # convert to python int\n0x1234\n\nYou can store these bitvectors back to registers and memory, or you can directly store a python integer and it'll be converted to a bitvector of the appropriate size:\n>>> state.regs.rsi = state.solver.BVV(3, 64)\n>>> state.regs.rsi\n\n\n>>> state.mem[0x1000].long = 4\n>>> state.mem[0x1000].long.resolved\n\n\nThe mem interface is a little confusing at first, since it's using some pretty hefty python magic. The short version of how to use it is:\n\nUse array[index] notation to specify an address\nUse . to specify that the memory should be interpreted as  (common values: char, short, int, long, size_t, uint8_t, uint16_t...)\nFrom there, you can either:\nStore a value to it, either a bitvector or a python int\nUse .resolved to get the value as a bitvector\nUse .concrete to get the value as a python int\n\n\n\nThere are more advanced usages that will be covered later!\nFinally, if you try reading some more registers you may encounter a very strange looking value:\n>>> state.regs.rdi\n\n\nThis is still a 64-bit bitvector, but it doesn't contain a numerical value.\nInstead, it has a name!\nThis is called a symbolic variable and it is the underpinning of symbolic execution.\nDon't panic! We will discuss all of this in detail exactly two chapters from now.\nSimulation Managers\nIf a state lets us represent a program at a given point in time, there must be a way to get it to the next point in time. A simulation manager is the primary interface in angr for performing execution, simulation, whatever you want to call it, with states. As a brief introduction, let's show how to tick that state we created earlier forward a few basic blocks.\nFirst, we create the simulation manager we're going to be using. The constructor can take a state or a list of states.\n>>> simgr = proj.factory.simulation_manager(state)\n\n>>> simgr.active\n[]\n\nA simulation manager can contain several stashes of states. The default stash, active, is initialized with the state we passed in. We could look at simgr.active[0] to look at our state some more, if we haven't had enough!\nNow... get ready, we're going to do some execution.\n>>> simgr.step()\n\nWe've just performed a basic block's worth of symbolic execution! We can look at the active stash again, noticing that it's been updated, and furthermore, that it has not modified our original state. SimState objects are treated as immutable by execution - you can safely use a single state as a \"base\" for multiple rounds of execution.\n>>> simgr.active\n[]\n>>> simgr.active[0].regs.rip                 # new and exciting!\n\n>>> state.regs.rip                           # still the same!\n\n\n/bin/true isn't a very good example for describing how to do interesting things with symbolic execution, so we'll stop here for now.\nAnalyses\nangr comes pre-packaged with several built-in analyses that you can use to extract some fun kinds of information from a program. Here they are:\n>>> proj.analyses.            # Press TAB here in ipython to get an autocomplete-listing of everything:\n proj.analyses.BackwardSlice        proj.analyses.CongruencyCheck      proj.analyses.reload_analyses       \n proj.analyses.BinaryOptimizer      proj.analyses.DDG                  proj.analyses.StaticHooker          \n proj.analyses.BinDiff              proj.analyses.DFG                  proj.analyses.VariableRecovery      \n proj.analyses.BoyScout             proj.analyses.Disassembly          proj.analyses.VariableRecoveryFast  \n proj.analyses.CDG                  proj.analyses.GirlScout            proj.analyses.Veritesting           \n proj.analyses.CFG                  proj.analyses.Identifier           proj.analyses.VFG                   \n proj.analyses.CFGEmulated          proj.analyses.LoopFinder           proj.analyses.VSA_DDG               \n proj.analyses.CFGFast              proj.analyses.Reassembler\nA couple of these are documented later in this book, but in general, if you want to find how to use a given analysis, you should look in the api documentation. As an extremely brief example: here's how you construct and use a quick control-flow graph:\n# Originally, when we loaded this binary it also loaded all its dependencies into the same virtual address  space\n# This is undesirable for most analysis.\n>>> proj = angr.Project('/bin/true', auto_load_libs=False)\n>>> cfg = proj.analyses.CFGFast()\n\n\n# cfg.graph is a networkx DiGraph full of CFGNode instances\n# You should go look up the networkx APIs to learn how to use this!\n>>> cfg.graph\n\n>>> len(cfg.graph.nodes())\n951\n\n# To get the CFGNode for a given address, use cfg.get_any_node\n>>> entry_node = cfg.get_any_node(proj.entry)\n>>> len(list(cfg.graph.successors(entry_node)))\n2\n\nNow what?\nHaving read this page, you should now be aquainted with several important angr concepts: basic blocks, states, bitvectors, simulation managers, and analyses. You can't really do anything interesting besides just use angr as a glorified debugger, though! Keep reading, and you will unlock deeper powers...\n"},"docs/loading.html":{"url":"docs/loading.html","title":"Loading a Binary","keywords":"","body":"Loading a Binary - CLE and angr Projects\nPreviously, you saw just the barest taste of angr's loading facilities - you loaded /bin/true, and then loaded it again without its shared libraries. You also saw proj.loader and a few things it could do. Now, we'll dive into the nuances of these interfaces and the things they can tell you.\nWe briefly mentioned angr's binary loading component, CLE. CLE stands for \"CLE Loads Everything\", and is responsible for taking a binary (and any libraries that it depends on) and presenting it to the rest of angr in a way that is easy to work with.\nThe Loader\nLet's load examples/fauxware/fauxware and take a deeper look at how to interact with the loader.\n>>> import angr, monkeyhex\n>>> proj = angr.Project('examples/fauxware/fauxware')\n>>> proj.loader\n\n\nLoaded Objects\nThe CLE loader (cle.Loader) represents an entire conglomerate of loaded binary objects, loaded and mapped into a single memory space.\nEach binary object is loaded by a loader backend that can handle its filetype (a subclass of cle.Backend).\nFor example, cle.ELF is used to load ELF binaries.\nThere will also be objects in memory that don't correspond to any loaded binary.\nFor example, an object used to provide thread-local storage support, and an externs object used to provide unresolved symbols.\nYou can get the full list of objects that CLE has loaded with loader.all_objects, as well as several more targeted classifications:\n# All loaded objects\n>>> proj.loader.all_objects\n[,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ,\n ]\n\n# This is the \"main\" object, the one that you directly specified when loading the project\n>>> proj.loader.main_object\n\n\n# This is a dictionary mapping from shared object name to object\n>>> proj.loader.shared_objects\n{ 'fauxware': ,\n  'libc.so.6': ,\n  'ld-linux-x86-64.so.2':  }\n\n# Here's all the objects that were loaded from ELF files\n# If this were a windows program we'd use all_pe_objects!\n>>> proj.loader.all_elf_objects\n[,\n ,\n ]\n\n# Here's the \"externs object\", which we use to provide addresses for unresolved imports and angr internals\n>>> proj.loader.extern_object\n\n\n# This object is used to provide addresses for emulated syscalls\n>>> proj.loader.kernel_object\n\n\n# Finally, you can to get a reference to an object given an address in it\n>>> proj.loader.find_object_containing(0x400000)\n\n\nYou can interact directly with these objects to extract metadata from them:\n>>> obj = proj.loader.main_object\n\n# The entry point of the object\n>>> obj.entry\n0x400580\n\n>>> obj.min_addr, obj.max_addr\n(0x400000, 0x60105f)\n\n# Retrieve this ELF's segments and sections\n>>> obj.segments\n,\n           ]>\n>>> obj.sections\n,\n           ,\n           ,\n            ...etc\n\n# You can get an individual segment or section by an address it contains:\n>>> obj.find_segment_containing(obj.entry)\n\n>>> obj.find_section_containing(obj.entry)\n\n\n# Get the address of the PLT stub for a symbol\n>>> addr = obj.plt['strcmp']\n>>> addr\n0x400550\n>>> obj.reverse_plt[addr]\n'strcmp'\n\n# Show the prelinked base of the object and the location it was actually mapped into memory by CLE\n>>> obj.linked_base\n0x400000\n>>> obj.mapped_base\n0x400000\n\nSymbols and Relocations\nYou can also work with symbols while using CLE.\nA symbol is a fundamental concept in the world of executable formats, effectively mapping a name to an address.\nThe easiest way to get a symbol from CLE is to use loader.find_symbol, which takes either a name or an address and returns a Symbol object.\n>>> strcmp = proj.loader.find_symbol('strcmp')\n>>> strcmp\n\n\nThe most useful attributes on a symbol are its name, its owner, and its address, but the \"address\" of a symbol can be ambiguous.\nThe Symbol object has three ways of reporting its address:\n\n.rebased_addr is its address in the global address space. This is what is shown in the print output.\n.linked_addr is its address relative to the prelinked base of the binary. This is the address reported in, for example, readelf(1).\n.relative_addr is its address relative to the object base. This is known in the literature (particularly the Windows literature) as an RVA (relative virtual address).\n\n>>> strcmp.name\n'strcmp'\n\n>>> strcmp.owner\n\n\n>>> strcmp.rebased_addr\n0x1089cd0\n>>> strcmp.linked_addr\n0x89cd0\n>>> strcmp.relative_addr\n0x89cd0\n\nIn addition to providing debug information, symbols also support the notion of dynamic linking.\nlibc provides the strcmp symbol as an export, and the main binary depends on it.\nIf we ask CLE to give us a strcmp symbol from the main object directly, it'll tell us that this is an import symbol.\nImport symbols do not have meaningful addresses associated with them, but they do provide a reference to the symbol that was used to resolve them, as .resolvedby.\n>>> strcmp.is_export\nTrue\n>>> strcmp.is_import\nFalse\n\n# On Loader, the method is find_symbol because it performs a search operation to find the symbol.\n# On an individual object, the method is get_symbol because there can only be one symbol with a given name.\n>>> main_strcmp = proj.loader.main_object.get_symbol('strcmp')\n>>> main_strcmp\n\n>>> main_strcmp.is_export\nFalse\n>>> main_strcmp.is_import\nTrue\n>>> main_strcmp.resolvedby\n\n\nThe specific ways that the links between imports and exports should be registered in memory are handled by another notion called relocations. \nA relocation says, \"when you match [import] up with an export symbol, please write the export's address to [location], formatted as [format].\"\nWe can see the full list of relocations for an object (as Relocation instances) as obj.relocs, or just a mapping from symbol name to Relocation as obj.imports.\nThere is no corresponding list of export symbols.\nA relocation's corresponding import symbol can be accessed as .symbol.\nThe address the relocation will write to is accessable through any of the address identifiers you can use for Symbol, and you can get a reference to the object requesting the relocation with .owner as well.\n# Relocations don't have a good pretty-printing, so those addresses are python-internal, unrelated to our program\n>>> proj.loader.shared_objects['libc.so.6'].imports\n{'__libc_enable_secure': ,\n '__tls_get_addr': ,\n '_dl_argv': ,\n '_dl_find_dso_for_object': ,\n '_dl_starting_up': ,\n '_rtld_global': ,\n '_rtld_global_ro': }\n\nIf an import cannot be resolved to any export, for example, because a shared library could not be found, CLE will automatically update the externs object (loader.extern_obj) to claim it provides the symbol as an export.\nLoading Options\nIf you are loading something with angr.Project and you want to pass an option to the cle.Loader instance that Project implicitly creates, you can just pass the keyword argument directly to the Project constructor, and it will be passed on to CLE.\nYou should look at the CLE API docs. if you want to know everything that could possibly be passed in as an option, but we will go over some important and frequently used options here.\nBasic Options\nWe've discussed auto_load_libs already - it enables or disables CLE's attempt to automatically resolve shared library dependencies, and is on by default.\nAdditionally, there is the opposite, except_missing_libs, which, if set to true, will cause an exception to be thrown whenever a binary has a shared library dependency that cannot be resolved.\nYou can pass a list of strings to force_load_libs and anything listed will be treated as an unresolved shared library dependency right out of the gate, or you can pass a list of strings to skip_libs to prevent any library of that name from being resolved as a dependency.\nAdditionally, you can pass a list of strings (or a single string) to ld_path, which will be used as an additional search path for shared libraries, before any of the defaults: the same directory as the loaded program, the current working directory, and your system libraries.\nPer-Binary Options\nIf you want to specify some options that only apply to a specific binary object, CLE will let you do that too. The parameters main_opts and lib_opts do this by taking dictionaries of options. main_opts is a mapping from option names to option values, while lib_opts is a mapping from library name to dictionaries mapping option names to option values.\nThe options that you can use vary from backend to backend, but some common ones are:\n\nbackend - which backend to use, as either a class or a name\nbase_addr - a base address to use\nentry_point - an entry point to use\narch - the name of an architecture to use\n\nExample:\n>>> angr.Project('examples/fauxware/fauxware', main_opts={'backend': 'blob', 'arch': 'i386'}, lib_opts={'libc.so.6': {'backend': 'elf'}})\n\n\nBackends\nCLE currently has backends for statically loading ELF, PE, CGC, Mach-O and ELF core dump files, as well as loading files into a flat address space. CLE will automatically detect the correct backend to use in most cases, so you shouldn't need to specify which backend you're using unless you're doing some pretty weird stuff.\nYou can force CLE to use a specific backend for an object by including a key in its options dictionary, as described above. Some backends cannot autodetect which architecture to use and must have a arch specified. The key doesn't need to match any list of architectures; angr will identify which architecture you mean given almost any common identifier for any supported arch.\nTo refer to a backend, use the name from this table:\n\n\n\nbackend name\ndescription\nrequires arch?\n\n\n\n\nelf\nStatic loader for ELF files based on PyELFTools\nno\n\n\npe\nStatic loader for PE files based on PEFile\nno\n\n\nmach-o\nStatic loader for Mach-O files. Does not support dynamic linking or rebasing.\nno\n\n\ncgc\nStatic loader for Cyber Grand Challenge binaries\nno\n\n\nbackedcgc\nStatic loader for CGC binaries that allows specifying memory and register backers\nno\n\n\nelfcore\nStatic loader for ELF core dumps\nno\n\n\nblob\nLoads the file into memory as a flat image\nyes\n\n\n\nSymbolic Function Summaries\nBy default, Project tries to replace external calls to library functions by using symbolic summaries termed SimProcedures - effectively just python functions that imitate the library function's effect on the state. We've implemented a whole bunch of functions as SimProcedures. These builtin procedures are available in the angr.SIM_PROCEDURES dictionary, which is two-leveled, keyed first on the package name (libc, posix, win32, stubs) and then on the name of the library function. Executing a SimProcedure instead of the actual library function that gets loaded from your system makes analysis a LOT more tractable, at the cost of some potential inaccuracies.\nWhen no such summary is available for a given function:\n\nif auto_load_libs is True (this is the default), then the real library function is executed instead. This may or may not be what you want, depending on the actual function. For example, some of libc's functions are extremely complex to analyze and will most likely cause an explosion of the number of states for the path trying to execute them.\nif auto_load_libs is False, then external functions are unresolved, and Project will resolve them to a generic \"stub\" SimProcedure called ReturnUnconstrained. It does what its name says: it returns a unique unconstrained symbolic value each time it is called.\nif use_sim_procedures (this is a parameter to angr.Project, not cle.Loader) is False (it is True by default), then only symbols provided by the extern object will be replaced with SimProcedures, and they will be replaced by a stub ReturnUnconstrained, which does nothing but return a symbolic value.\nyou may specify specific symbols to exclude from being replaced with SimProcedures with the parameters to angr.Project: exclude_sim_procedures_list and exclude_sim_procedures_func.\nLook at the code for angr.Project._register_object for the exact algorithm.\n\nHooking\nThe mechanism by which angr replaces library code with a python summary is called hooking, and you can do it too! When performing simulation, at every step angr checks if the current address has been hooked, and if so, runs the hook instead of the binary code at that address. The API to let you do this is proj.hook(addr, hook), where hook is a SimProcedure instance. You can manage your project's hooks with .is_hooked, .unhook, and .hooked_by, which should hopefully not require explanation.\nThere is an alternate API for hooking an address that lets you specify your own off-the-cuff function to use as a hook, by using proj.hook(addr) as a function decorator. If you do this, you can also optionally specify a length keyword argument to make execution jump some number of bytes forward after your hook finishes.\n>>> stub_func = angr.SIM_PROCEDURES['stubs']['ReturnUnconstrained'] # this is a CLASS\n>>> proj.hook(0x10000, stub_func())  # hook with an instance of the class\n\n>>> proj.is_hooked(0x10000)            # these functions should be pretty self-explanitory\nTrue\n>>> proj.hooked_by(0x10000)\n\n>>> proj.unhook(0x10000)\n\n>>> @proj.hook(0x20000, length=5)\n... def my_hook(state):\n...     state.regs.rax = 1\n\n>>> proj.is_hooked(0x20000)\nTrue\n\nFurthermore, you can use proj.hook_symbol(name, hook), providing the name of a symbol as the first argument, to hook the address where the symbol lives.\nOne very important usage of this is to extend the behavior of angr's built-in library SimProcedures.\nSince these library functions are just classes, you can subclass them, overriding pieces of their behavior, and then use your subclass in a hook.\nSo far so good!\nBy now, you should have a reasonable understanding of how to control the environment in which your analysis happens, on the level of the CLE loader and the angr Project.\nYou should also understand that angr makes a reasonable attempt to simplify its analysis by hooking complex library functions with SimProcedures that summarize the effects of the functions.\nIn order to see all the things you can do with the CLE loader and its backends, look at the CLE API docs.\n"},"docs/solver.html":{"url":"docs/solver.html","title":"Solver Engine","keywords":"","body":"Symbolic Expressions and Constraint Solving\nangr's power comes not from it being an emulator, but from being able to execute with what we call symbolic variables.\nInstead of saying that a variable has a concrete numerical value, we can say that it holds a symbol, effectively just a name.\nThen, performing arithmetic operations with that variable will yield a tree of operations (termed an abstract syntax tree or AST, from compiler theory).\nASTs can be translated into constraints for an SMT solver, like z3, in order to ask questions like \"given the output of this sequence of operations, what must the input have been?\"\nHere, you'll learn how to use angr to answer this.\nWorking with Bitvectors\nLet's get a dummy project and state so we can start playing with numbers.\n>>> import angr, monkeyhex\n>>> proj = angr.Project('/bin/true')\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n\nA bitvector is just a sequence of bits, interpreted with the semantics of a bounded integer for arithmetic.\nLet's make a few.\n# 64-bit bitvectors with concrete values 1 and 100\n>>> one = state.solver.BVV(1, 64)\n>>> one\n \n>>> one_hundred = state.solver.BVV(100, 64)\n>>> one_hundred\n \n\n# create a 27-bit bitvector with concrete value 9\n>>> weird_nine = state.solver.BVV(9, 27)\n>>> weird_nine\n\n\nAs you can see, you can have any sequence of bits and call them a bitvector.\nYou can do math with them too:\n>>> one + one_hundred\n\n\n# You can provide normal python integers and they will be coerced to the appropriate type:\n>>> one_hundred + 0x100\n\n\n# The semantics of normal wrapping arithmetic apply\n>>> one_hundred -

not a bitvector, but now a symbolic boolean.\n>>> x == 1\n\n>>> x == one\n\n>>> x > 2\n 0x2>\n>>> x + y == one_hundred + 5\n\n>>> one_hundred > 5\n\n>>> one_hundred > -5\n\n\nOne tidbit you can see from this is that the comparisons are unsigned by default.\nThe -5 in the last example is coerced to , which is definitely not less than one hundred.\nIf you want the comparison to be signed, you can say one_hundred.SGT(-5) (that's \"signed greater-than\").\nA full list of operations can be found at the end of this chapter.\nThis snippet also illustrates an important point about working with angr - you should never directly use a comparison between variables in the condition for an if- or while-statement, since the answer might not have a concrete truth value.\nEven if there is a concrete truth value, if one > one_hundred will raise an exception.\nInstead, you should use solver.is_true and solver.is_false, which test for concrete truthyness/falsiness without performing a constraint solve.\n>>> yes = one == 1\n>>> no = one == 2\n>>> maybe = x == y\n>>> state.solver.is_true(yes)\nTrue\n>>> state.solver.is_false(yes)\nFalse\n>>> state.solver.is_true(no)\nFalse\n>>> state.solver.is_false(no)\nTrue\n>>> state.solver.is_true(maybe)\nFalse\n>>> state.solver.is_false(maybe)\nFalse\n\nConstraint Solving\nYou can treat any symbolic boolean as an assertion about the valid values of a symbolic variable by adding it as a constraint to the state.\nYou can then query for a valid value of a symbolic variable by asking for an evaluation of a symbolic expression.\nAn example will probably be more clear than an explanation here:\n>>> state.solver.add(x > y)\n>>> state.solver.add(y > 2)\n>>> state.solver.add(10 > x)\n>>> state.solver.eval(x)\n4\n\nBy adding these constraints to the state, we've forced the constraint solver to consider them as assertions that must be satisfied about any values it returns.\nIf you run this code, you might get a different value for x, but that value will definitely be greater than 3 (since y must be greater than 2 and x must be greater than y) and less than 10.\nFurthermore, if you then say state.solver.eval(y), you'll get a value of y which is consistent with the value of x that you got.\nIf you don't add any constraints between two queries, the results will be consistent with each other.\nFrom here, it's easy to see how to do the task we proposed at the beginning of the chapter - finding the input that produced a given output.\n# get a fresh state without constraints\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n>>> input = state.solver.BVS('input', 64)\n>>> operation = (((input + 4) * 3) >> 1) + input\n>>> output = 200\n>>> state.solver.add(operation == output)\n>>> state.solver.eval(input)\n0x3333333333333381\n\nNote that, again, this solution only works because of the bitvector semantics.\nIf we were operating over the domain of integers, there would be no solutions!\nIf we add conflicting or contradictory constraints, such that there are no values that can be assigned to the variables such that the constraints are satisfied, the state becomes unsatisfiable, or unsat, and queries against it will raise an exception.\nYou can check the satisfiability of a state with state.satisfiable().\n>>> state.solver.add(input >> state.satisfiable()\nFalse\n\nYou can also evaluate more complex expressions, not just single variables.\n# fresh state\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n>>> state.solver.add(x - y >= 4)\n>>> state.solver.add(y > 0)\n>>> state.solver.eval(x)\n5\n>>> state.solver.eval(y)\n1\n>>> state.solver.eval(x + y)\n6\n\nFrom this we can see that eval is a general purpose method to convert any bitvector into a python primitive while respecting the integrity of the state.\nThis is why we use eval to convert from concrete bitvectors to python ints, too!\nAlso note that the x and y variables can be used in this new state despite having been created using an old state.\nVariables are not tied to any one state, and can exist freely.\nFloating point numbers\nz3 has support for the theory of IEEE754 floating point numbers, and so angr can use them as well.\nThe main difference is that instead of a width, a floating point number has a sort.\nYou can create floating point symbols and values with FPV and FPS.\n# fresh state\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n>>> a = state.solver.FPV(3.2, state.solver.fp.FSORT_DOUBLE)\n>>> a\n\n\n>>> b = state.solver.FPS('b', state.solver.fp.FSORT_DOUBLE)\n>>> b\n\n\n>>> a + b\n\n\n>>> a + 4.4\n\n\n>>> b + 2 \n\nSo there's a bit to unpack here - for starters the pretty-printing isn't as smart about floating point numbers.\nBut past that, most operations actually have a third parameter, implicitly added when you use the binary operators - the rounding mode.\nThe IEEE754 spec supports multiple rounding modes (round-to-nearest, round-to-zero, round-to-positive, etc), so z3 has to support them.\nIf you want to specify the rounding mode for an operation, use the fp operation explicitly (solver.fpAdd for example) with a rounding mode (one of solver.fp.RM_*) as the first argument.\nConstraints and solving work in the same way, but with eval returning a floating point number:\n>>> state.solver.add(b + 2 >> state.solver.add(b + 2 > -1)\n>>> state.solver.eval(b)\n-2.4999999999999996\n\nThis is nice, but sometimes we need to be able to work directly with the representation of the float as a bitvector.\nYou can interpret bitvectors as floats and vice versa, with the methods raw_to_bv and raw_to_fp:\n>>> a.raw_to_bv()\n\n>>> b.raw_to_bv()\n\n\n>>> state.solver.BVV(0, 64).raw_to_fp()\n\n>>> state.solver.BVS('x', 64).raw_to_fp()\n\n\nThese conversions preserve the bit-pattern, as if you casted a float pointer to an int pointer or vice versa.\nHowever, if you want to preserve the value as closely as possible, as if you casted a float to an int (or vice versa), you can use a different set of methods, val_to_fp and val_to_bv.\nThese methods must take the size or sort of the target value as a parameter, due to the floating-point nature of floats.\n>>> a\n\n>>> a.val_to_bv(12)\n\n>>> a.val_to_bv(12).val_to_fp(state.solver.fp.FSORT_FLOAT)\n\n\nThese methods can also take a signed parameter, designating the signedness of the source or target bitvector.\nMore Solving Methods\neval will give you one possible solution to an expression, but what if you want several?\nWhat if you want to ensure that the solution is unique?\nThe solver provides you with several methods for common solving patterns:\n\nsolver.eval(expression) will give you one possible solution to the given expression.\nsolver.eval_one(expression) will give you the solution to the given expression, or throw an error if more than one solution is possible.\nsolver.eval_upto(expression, n) will give you up to n solutions to the given expression, returning fewer than n if fewer than n are possible.\nsolver.eval_atleast(expression, n) will give you n solutions to the given expression, throwing an error if fewer than n are possible.\nsolver.eval_exact(expression, n) will give you n solutions to the given expression, throwing an error if fewer or more than are possible.\nsolver.min(expression) will give you the minimum possible solution to the given expression.\nsolver.max(expression) will give you the maximum possible solution to the given expression.\n\nAdditionally, all of these methods can take the following keyword arguments:\n\nextra_constraints can be passed as a tuple of constraints.\nThese constraints will be taken into account for this evaluation, but will not be added to the state.\ncast_to can be passed a data type to cast the result to.\nCurrently, this can only be int and bytes, which will cause the method to return the corresponding representation of the underlying data.\nFor example, state.solver.eval(state.solver.BVV(0x41424344, 32), cast_to=bytes) will return b'ABCD'.\n\nSummary\nThat was a lot!!\nAfter reading this, you should be able to create and manipulate bitvectors, booleans, and floating point values to form trees of operations, and then query the constraint solver attached to a state for possible solutions under a set of constraints.\nHopefully by this point you understand the power of using ASTs to represent computations, and the power of a constraint solver.\nIn the appendix, you can find a reference for all the additional operations you can apply to ASTs, in case you ever need a quick table to look at.\n"},"docs/states.html":{"url":"docs/states.html","title":"Program State","keywords":"","body":"Machine State - memory, registers, and so on\nSo far, we've only used angr's simulated program states (SimState objects) in the barest possible way in order to demonstrate basic concepts about angr's operation. Here, you'll learn about the structure of a state object and how to interact with it in a variety of useful ways.\nReview: Reading and writing memory and registers\nIf you've been reading this book in order (and you should be, at least for this first section), you already saw the basics of how to access memory and registers.\nstate.regs provides read and write access to the registers through attributes with the names of each register, and state.mem provides typed read and write access to memory with index-access notation to specify the address followed by an attribute access to specify the type you would like to interpret the memory as.\nAdditionally, you should now know how to work with ASTs, so you can now understand that any bitvector-typed AST can be stored in registers or memory.\nHere are some quick examples for copying and performing operations on data from the state:\n>>> import angr, claripy\n>>> proj = angr.Project('/bin/true')\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n\n# copy rsp to rbp\n>>> state.regs.rbp = state.regs.rsp\n\n# store rdx to memory at 0x1000\n>>> state.mem[0x1000].uint64_t = state.regs.rdx\n\n# dereference rbp\n>>> state.regs.rbp = state.mem[state.regs.rbp].uint64_t.resolved\n\n# add rax, qword ptr [rsp + 8]\n>>> state.regs.rax += state.mem[state.regs.rsp + 8].uint64_t.resolved\n\nBasic Execution\nEarlier, we showed how to use a Simulation Manager to do some basic execution.\nWe'll show off the full capabilities of the simulation manager in the next chapter, but for now we can use a much simpler interface to demonstrate how symbolic execution works: state.step().\nThis method will perform one step of symbolic execution and return an object called SimSuccessors.\nUnlike normal emulation, symbolic execution can produce several successor states that can be classified in a number of ways.\nFor now, what we care about is the .successors property of this object, which is a list containing all the \"normal\" successors of a given step.\nWhy a list, instead of just a single successor state?\nWell, angr's process of symbolic execution is just the taking the operations of the individual instructions compiled into the program and performing them to mutate a SimState.\nWhen a line of code like if (x > 4) is reached, what happens if x is a symbolic bitvector?\nSomewhere in the depths of angr, the comparison x > 4 is going to get performed, and the result is going to be  4>.\nThat's fine, but the next question is, do we take the \"true\" branch or the \"false\" one?\nThe answer is, we take both!\nWe generate two entirely separate successor states - one simulating the case where the condition was true and simulating the case where the condition was false.\nIn the first state, we add x > 4 as a constraint, and in the second state, we add !(x > 4) as a constraint.\nThat way, whenever we perform a constraint solve using either of these successor states, the conditions on the state ensure that any solutions we get are valid inputs that will cause execution to follow the same path that the given state has followed.\nTo demonstrate this, let's use a fake firmware image as an example.\nIf you look at the source code for this binary, you'll see that the authentication mechanism for the firmware is backdoored; any username can be authenticated as an administrator with the password \"SOSNEAKY\".\nFurthermore, the first comparison against user input that happens is the comparison against the backdoor, so if we step until we get more than one successor state, one of those states will contain conditions constraining the user input to be the backdoor password.\nThe following snippet implements this:\n>>> proj = angr.Project('examples/fauxware/fauxware')\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state(stdin=angr.SimFile)  # ignore that argument for now - we're disabling a more complicated default setup for the sake of education\n>>> while True:\n...     succ = state.step()\n...     if len(succ.successors) == 2:\n...         break\n...     state = succ.successors[0]\n\n>>> state1, state2 = succ.successors\n>>> state1\n\n>>> state2\n\nDon't look at the constraints on these states directly - the branch we just went through involves the result of strcmp, which is a tricky function to emulate symbolically, and the resulting constraints are very complicated.\nThe program we emulated took data from standard input, which angr treats as an infinite stream of symbolic data by default.\nTo perform a constraint solve and get a possible value that input could have taken in order to satisfy the constraints, we'll need to get a reference to the actual contents of stdin.\nWe'll go over how our file and input subsystems work later on this very page, but for now, just use state.posix.stdin.load(0, state.posix.stdin.size) to retrieve a bitvector representing all the content read from stdin so far.\n>>> input_data = state1.posix.stdin.load(0, state.posix.stdin.size)\n\n>>> state1.solver.eval(input_data, cast_to=bytes)\nb'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00SOSNEAKY\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\n>>> state2.solver.eval(input_data, cast_to=bytes)\nb'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00S\\x00\\x80N\\x00\\x00 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\nAs you can see, in order to go down the state1 path, you must have given as a password the backdoor string \"SOSNEAKY\".\nIn order to go down the state2 path, you must have given something besides \"SOSNEAKY\".\nz3 has helpfully provided one of the billions of strings fitting this criteria.\nFauxware was the first program angr's symbolic execution ever successfully worked on, back in 2013.\nBy finding its backdoor using angr you are participating in a grand tradition of having a bare-bones understanding of how to use symbolic execution to extract meaning from binaries!\nState Presets\nSo far, whenever we've been working with a state, we've created it with project.factory.entry_state().\nThis is just one of several state constructors available on the project factory:\n\n.blank_state() constructs a \"blank slate\" blank state, with most of its data left uninitialized.\nWhen accessing uninitialized data, an unconstrained symbolic value will be returned.\n.entry_state() constructs a state ready to execute at the main binary's entry point.\n.full_init_state() constructs a state that is ready to execute through any initializers that need to be run before the main binary's entry point, for example, shared library constructors or preinitializers.\nWhen it is finished with these it will jump to the entry point.\n.call_state() constructs a state ready to execute a given function.\n\nYou can customize the state through several arguments to these constructors:\n\nAll of these constructors can take an addr argument to specify the exact address to start.\n\nIf you're executing in an environment that can take command line arguments or an environment, you can pass a list of arguments through args and a dictionary of environment variables through env into entry_state and full_init_state.\nThe values in these structures can be strings or bitvectors, and will be serialized into the state as the arguments and environment to the simulated execution.\nThe default args is an empty list, so if the program you're analyzing expects to find at least an argv[0], you should always provide that!\n\nIf you'd like to have argc be symbolic, you can pass a symbolic bitvector as argc to the entry_state and full_init_state constructors.\nBe careful, though: if you do this, you should also add a constraint to the resulting state that your value for argc cannot be larger than the number of args you passed into args.\n\nTo use the call state, you should call it with .call_state(addr, arg1, arg2, ...), where addr is the address of the function you want to call and argN is the Nth argument to that function, either as a python integer, string, or array, or a bitvector.\nIf you want to have memory allocated and actually pass in a pointer to an object, you should wrap it in an PointerWrapper, i.e. angr.PointerWrapper(\"point to me!\").\nThe results of this API can be a little unpredictable, but we're working on it.\n\nTo specify the calling convention used for a function with call_state, you can pass a SimCC instance as the cc argument.We try to pick a sane default, but for special cases you will need to help angr out.\n\n\nThere are several more options that can be used in any of these constructors! See the docs on the project.factory object (an AngrObjectFactory) for more details.\nLow level interface for memory\nThe state.mem interface is convenient for loading typed data from memory, but when you want to do raw loads and stores to and from ranges of memory, it's very cumbersome.\nIt turns out that state.mem is actually just a bunch of logic to correctly access the underlying memory storage, which is just a flat address space filled with bitvector data: state.memory.\nYou can use state.memory directly with the .load(addr, size) and .store(addr, val) methods:\n>>> s = proj.factory.blank_state()\n>>> s.memory.store(0x4000, s.solver.BVV(0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef, 128))\n>>> s.memory.load(0x4004, 6) # load-size is in bytes\n\n\nAs you can see, the data is loaded and stored in a \"big-endian\" fashion, since the primary purpose of state.memory is to load an store swaths of data with no attached semantics.\nHowever, if you want to perform a byteswap on the loaded or stored data, you can pass a keyword argument endness - if you specify little-endian, byteswap will happen.\nThe endness should be one of the members of the Endness enum in the archinfo package used to hold declarative data about CPU architectures for angr.\nAdditionally, the endness of the program being analyzed can be found as arch.memory_endness - for instance state.arch.memory_endness.\n>>> import archinfo\n>>> s.memory.load(0x4000, 4, endness=archinfo.Endness.LE)\n\n\nThere is also a low-level interface for register access, state.registers, that uses the exact same API as state.memory, but explaining its behavior involves a dive into the abstractions that angr uses to seamlessly work with multiple architectures.\nThe short version is that it is simply a register file, with the mapping between registers and offsets defined in archinfo.\nState Options\nThere are a lot of little tweaks that can be made to the internals of angr that will optimize behavior in some situations and be a detriment in others.\nThese tweaks are controlled through state options.\nOn each SimState object, there is a set (state.options) of all its enabled options.\nEach option (really just a string) controls the behavior of angr's execution engine in some minute way.\nA listing of the full domain of options, along with the defaults for different state types, can be found in the appendix.\nYou can access an individual option for adding to a state through angr.options.\nThe individual options are named with CAPITAL_LETTERS, but there are also common groupings of objects that you might want to use bundled together, named with lowercase_letters.\nWhen creating a SimState through any constructor, you may pass the keyword arguments add_options and remove_options, which should be sets of options that modify the initial options set from the default.\n# Example: enable lazy solves, an option that causes state satisfiability to be checked as infrequently as possible.\n# This change to the settings will be propagated to all successor states created from this state after this line.\n>>> s.options.add(angr.options.LAZY_SOLVES)\n\n# Create a new state with lazy solves enabled\n>>> s = proj.factory.entry_state(add_options={angr.options.LAZY_SOLVES})\n\n# Create a new state without simplification options enabled\n>>> s = proj.factory.entry_state(remove_options=angr.options.simplification)\n\nState Plugins\nWith the exception of the set of options just discussed, everything stored in a SimState is actually stored in a plugin attached to the state.\nAlmost every property on the state we've discussed so far is a plugin - memory, registers, mem, regs, solver, etc.\nThis design allows for code modularity as well as the ability to easily implement new kinds of data storage for other aspects of an emulated state, or the ability to provide alternate implementations of plugins.\nFor example, the normal memory plugin simulates a flat memory space, but analyses can choose to enable the \"abstract memory\" plugin, which uses alternate data types for addresses to simulate free-floating memory mappings independent of address, to provide state.memory.\nConversely, plugins can reduce code complexity: state.memory and state.registers are actually two different instances of the same plugin, since the registers are emulated with an address space as well.\nThe globals plugin\nstate.globals is an extremely simple plugin: it implements the interface of a standard python dict, allowing you to store arbitrary data on a state.\nThe history plugin\nstate.history is a very important plugin storing historical data about the path a state has taken during execution.\nIt is actually a linked list of several history nodes, each one representing a single round of execution---you can traverse this list with state.history.parent.parent etc.\nTo make it more convenient to work with this structure, the history also provides several efficient iterators over the history of certain values.\nIn general, these values are stored as history.recent_NAME and the iterator over them is just history.NAME.\nFor example, for addr in state.history.bbl_addrs: print hex(addr) will print out a basic block address trace for the binary, while state.history.recent_bbl_addrs is the list of basic blocks executed in the most recent step, state.history.parent.recent_bbl_addrs is the list of basic blocks executed in the previous step, etc.\nIf you ever need to quickly obtain a flat list of these values, you can access .hardcopy, e.g. state.history.bbl_addrs.hardcopy.\nKeep in mind though, index-based accessing is implemented on the iterators.\nHere is a brief listing of some of the values stored in the history:\n\nhistory.descriptions is a listing of string descriptions of each of the rounds of execution performed on the state.\nhistory.bbl_addrs is a listing of the basic block addresses executed by the state.\nThere may be more than one per round of execution, and not all addresses may correspond to binary code - some may be addresses at which SimProcedures are hooked.\nhistory.jumpkinds is a listing of the disposition of each of the control flow transitions in the state's history, as VEX enum strings.\nhistory.jump_guards is a listing of the conditions guarding each of the branches that the state has encountered.\nhistory.events is a semantic listing of \"interesting events\" which happened during execution, such as the presence of a symbolic jump condition, the program popping up a message box, or execution terminating with an exit code.\nhistory.actions is usually empty, but if you add the angr.options.refs options to the state, it will be populated with a log of all the memory, register, and temporary value accesses performed by the program.\n\nThe callstack plugin\nangr will track the call stack for the emulated program.\nOn every call instruction, a frame will be added to the top of the tracked callstack, and whenever the stack pointer drops below the point where the topmost frame was called, a frame is popped.\nThis allows angr to robustly store data local to the current emulated function.\nSimilar to the history, the callstack is also a linked list of nodes, but there are no provided iterators over the contents of the nodes - instead you can directly iterate over state.callstack to get the callstack frames for each of the active frames, in order from most recent to oldest.\nIf you just want the topmost frame, this is state.callstack.\n\ncallstack.func_addr is the address of the function currently being executed\ncallstack.call_site_addr is the address of the basic block which called the current function\ncallstack.stack_ptr is the value of the stack pointer from the beginning of the current function\ncallstack.ret_addr is the location that the current function will return to if it returns\n\nMore about I/O: Files, file systems, and network sockets\nPlease refer to Working with File System, Sockets, and Pipes for a more complete and detailed documentation of how I/O is modeled in angr.\nCopying and Merging\nA state supports very fast copies, so that you can explore different possibilities:\n>>> proj = angr.Project('/bin/true')\n>>> s = proj.factory.blank_state()\n>>> s1 = s.copy()\n>>> s2 = s.copy()\n\n>>> s1.mem[0x1000].uint32_t = 0x41414141\n>>> s2.mem[0x1000].uint32_t = 0x42424242\n\nStates can also be merged together.\n# merge will return a tuple. the first element is the merged state\n# the second element is a symbolic variable describing a state flag\n# the third element is a boolean describing whether any merging was done\n>>> (s_merged, m, anything_merged) = s1.merge(s2)\n\n# this is now an expression that can resolve to \"AAAA\" *or* \"BBBB\"\n>>> aaaa_or_bbbb = s_merged.mem[0x1000].uint32_t\n\nTODO: describe limitations of merging\n"},"docs/pathgroups.html":{"url":"docs/pathgroups.html","title":"Simulation Managers","keywords":"","body":"Simulation Managers\nThe most important control interface in angr is the SimulationManager, which allows you to control symbolic execution over groups of states simultaneously, applying search strategies to explore a program's state space.\nHere, you'll learn how to use it.\nSimulation managers let you wrangle multiple states in a slick way.\nStates are organized into “stashes”, which you can step forward, filter, merge, and move around as you wish.\nThis allows you to, for example, step two different stashes of states at different rates, then merge them together.\nThe default stash for most operations is the active stash, which is where your states get put when you initialize a new simulation manager.\nStepping\nThe most basic capability of a simulation manager is to step forward all states in a given stash by one basic block.\nYou do this with .step().\n>>> import angr\n>>> proj = angr.Project('examples/fauxware/fauxware', auto_load_libs=False)\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state()\n>>> simgr = proj.factory.simgr(state)\n>>> simgr.active\n[]\n\n>>> simgr.step()\n>>> simgr.active\n[]\n\nOf course, the real power of the stash model is that when a state encounters a symbolic branch condition, both of the successor states appear in the stash, and you can step both of them in sync.\nWhen you don't really care about controlling analysis very carefully and you just want to step until there's nothing left to step, you can just use the .run() method.\n# Step until the first symbolic branch\n>>> while len(simgr.active) == 1:\n...    simgr.step()\n\n>>> simgr\n\n>>> simgr.active\n[, ]\n\n# Step until everything terminates\n>>> simgr.run()\n>>> simgr\n\n\nWe now have 3 deadended states!\nWhen a state fails to produce any successors during execution, for example, because it reached an exit syscall, it is removed from the active stash and placed in the deadended stash.\nStash Management\nLet's see how to work with other stashes.\nTo move states between stashes, use .move(),  which takes from_stash, to_stash, and filter_func (optional, default is to move everything).\nFor example, let's move everything that has a certain string in its output:\n>>> simgr.move(from_stash='deadended', to_stash='authenticated', filter_func=lambda s: b'Welcome' in s.posix.dumps(1))\n>>> simgr\n\n\nWe were able to just create a new stash named \"authenticated\" just by asking for states to be moved to it.\nAll the states in

there are some alternate methods to access the states too.\nIf you prepend the name of a stash with one_, you will be given the first state in the stash.\nIf you prepend the name of a stash with mp_, you will be given a mulpyplexed version of the stash.\n>>> for s in simgr.deadended + simgr.authenticated:\n...     print(hex(s.addr))\n0x1000030\n0x1000078\n0x1000078\n\n>>>

specifying which stash to operate on.\nThere are lots of fun tools that the simulation manager provides you for managing your stashes.\nWe won't go into the rest of them for now, but you should check out the API documentation. TODO: link\nStash types\nYou can use stashes for whatever you like, but there are a few stashes that will be used to categorize some special kinds of states.\nThese are:\n\n\n\nStash\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nactive\nThis stash contains the states that will be stepped by default, unless an alternate stash is specified.\n\n\ndeadended\nA state goes to the deadended stash when it cannot continue the execution for some reason, including no more valid instructions, unsat state of all of its successors, or an invalid instruction pointer.\n\n\npruned\nWhen using LAZY_SOLVES, states are not checked for satisfiability unless absolutely necessary. When a state is found to be unsat in the presence of LAZY_SOLVES, the state hierarchy is traversed to identify when, in its history, it initially became unsat. All states that are descendants of that point (which will also be unsat, since a state cannot become un-unsat) are pruned and put in this stash.\n\n\nunconstrained\nIf the save_unconstrained option is provided to the SimulationManager constructor, states that are determined to be unconstrained (i.e., with the instruction pointer controlled by user data or some other source of symbolic data) are placed here.\n\n\nunsat\nIf the save_unsat option is provided to the SimulationManager constructor, states that are determined to be unsatisfiable (i.e., they have constraints that are contradictory, like the input having to be both \"AAAA\" and \"BBBB\" at the same time) are placed here.\n\n\n\nThere is another list of states that is not a stash: errored.\nIf, during execution, an error is raised, then the state will be wrapped in an ErrorRecord object, which contains the state and the error it raised, and then the record will be inserted into errored.\nYou can get at the state as it was at the beginning of the execution tick that caused the error with record.state, you can see the error that was raised with record.error, and you can launch a debug shell at the site of the error with record.debug().\nThis is an invaluable debugging tool!\nSimple Exploration\nAn extremely common operation in symbolic execution is to find a state that reaches a certain address, while discarding all states that go through another address.\nSimulation manager has a shortcut for this pattern, the .explore() method.\nWhen launching .explore() with a find argument, execution will run until a state is found that matches the find condition, which can be the address of an instruction to stop at, a list of addresses to stop at, or a function which takes a state and returns whether it meets some criteria.\nWhen any of the states in the active stash match the find condition, they are placed in the found stash, and execution terminates.\nYou can then explore the found state, or decide to discard it and continue with the other ones.\nYou can also specify an avoid condition in the same format as find.\nWhen a state matches the avoid condition, it is put in the avoided stash, and execution continues.\nFinally, the num_find argument controls the number of states that should be found before returning, with a default of 1.\nOf course, if you run out of states in the active stash before finding this many solutions, execution will stop anyway.\nLet's look at a simple crackme example:\nFirst, we load the binary.\n>>> proj = angr.Project('examples/CSCI-4968-MBE/challenges/crackme0x00a/crackme0x00a')\n\nNext, we create a SimulationManager.\n>>> simgr = proj.factory.simgr()\n\nNow, we symbolically execute until we find a state that matches our condition (i.e., the \"win\" condition).\n>>> simgr.explore(find=lambda s: b\"Congrats\" in s.posix.dumps(1))\n\n\nNow, we can get the flag out of that state!\n>>> s = simgr.found[0]\n>>> print(s.posix.dumps(1))\nEnter password: Congrats!\n\n>>> flag = s.posix.dumps(0)\n>>> print(flag)\ng00dJ0B!\n\nPretty simple, isn't it?\nOther examples can be found by browsing the examples.\nExploration Techniques\nangr ships with several pieces of canned functionality that let you customize the behavior of a simulation manager, called exploration techniques.\nThe archetypical example of why you would want an exploration technique is to modify the pattern in which the state space of the program is explored - the default \"step everything at once\" strategy is effectively breadth-first search, but with an exploration technique you could implement, for example, depth-first search.\nHowever, the instrumentation power of these techniques is much more flexible than that - you can totally alter the behavior of angr's stepping process.\nWriting your own exploration techniques will be covered in a later chapter.\nTo use an exploration technique, call simgr.use_technique(tech), where tech is an instance of an ExplorationTechnique subclass.\nangr's built-in exploration techniques can be found under angr.exploration_techniques.\nHere's a quick overview of some of the built-in ones:\n\nDFS: Depth first search, as mentioned earlier. Keeps only one state active at once, putting the rest in the deferred stash until it deadends or errors.\nExplorer: This technique implements the .explore() functionality, allowing you to search for and avoid addresses.\nLengthLimiter: Puts a cap on the maximum length of the path a state goes through.\nLoopSeer: Uses a reasonable approximation of loop counting to discard states that appear to be going through a loop too many times, putting them in a spinning stash and pulling them out again if we run out of otherwise viable states.\nManualMergepoint: Marks an address in the program as a merge point, so states that reach that address will be briefly held, and any other states that reach that same point within a timeout will be merged together.\nMemoryWatcher: Monitors how much memory is free/available on the system between simgr steps and stops exploration if it gets too low.\nOppologist: The \"operation apologist\" is an especially fun gadget - if this technique is enabled and angr encounters an unsupported instruction, for example a bizzare and foreign floating point SIMD op, it will concretize all the inputs to that instruction and emulate the single instruction using the unicorn engine, allowing execution to continue.\nSpiller: When there are too many states active, this technique can dump some of them to disk in order to keep memory consumption low.\nThreading: Adds thread-level parallelism to the stepping process. This doesn't help much because of python's global interpreter locks, but if you have a program whose analysis spends a lot of time in angr's native-code dependencies (unicorn, z3, libvex) you can seem some gains.\nTracer: An exploration technique that causes execution to follow a dynamic trace recorded from some other source. The dynamic tracer repository has some tools to generate those traces.\nVeritesting: An implementation of a CMU paper on automatically identifying useful merge points. This is so useful, you can enable it automatically with veritesting=True in the SimulationManager constructor! Note that it frequenly doesn't play nice with other techniques due to the invasive way it implements static symbolic execution.\n\nLook at the API documentation for the simulation manager and exploration techniques for more information.\n"},"docs/simulation.html":{"url":"docs/simulation.html","title":"Execution Engines","keywords":"","body":"Simulation  and Instrumentation\nWhen you ask for a step of execution to happen in angr, something has to actually perform the step.\nangr uses a series of engines (subclasses of the SimEngine class) to emulate the effects that of a given section of code has on an input state.\nThe execution core of angr simply tries all the available engines in sequence, taking the first one that is able to handle the step.\nThe following is the default list of engines, in order:\n\nThe failure engine kicks in when the previous step took us to some uncontinuable state\nThe syscall engine kicks in when the previous step ended in a syscall\nThe hook engine kicks in when the current address is hooked\nThe unicorn engine kicks in when the UNICORN state option is enabled and there is no symbolic data in the state\nThe VEX engine kicks in as the final fallback.\n\nSimSuccessors\nThe code that actually tries all the engines in turn is project.factory.successors(state, **kwargs), which passes its arguments onto each of the engines.\nThis function is at the heart of state.step() and simulation_manager.step().\nIt returns a SimSuccessors object, which we discussed briefly before.\nThe purpose of SimSuccessors is to perform a simple categorization of the successor states, stored in various list attributes.\nThey are:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nGuard Condition\nInstruction Pointer\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsuccessors\nTrue (can be symbolic, but constrained to True)\nCan be symbolic (but 256 solutions or less; see unconstrained_successors).\nA normal, satisfiable successor state to the state processed by the engine. The instruction pointer of this state may be symbolic (i.e., a computed jump based on user input), so the state might actually represent several potential continuations of execution going forward.\n\n\nunsat_successors\nFalse (can be symbolic, but constrained to False).\nCan be symbolic.\nUnsatisfiable successors. These are successors whose guard conditions can only be false (i.e., jumps that cannot be taken, or the default branch of jumps that must be taken).\n\n\nflat_successors\nTrue (can be symbolic, but constrained to True).\nConcrete value.\nAs noted above, states in the successors list can have symbolic instruction pointers. This is rather confusing, as elsewhere in the code (i.e., in SimEngineVEX.process, when it's time to step that state forward), we make assumptions that a single program state only represents the execution of a single spot in the code. To alleviate this, when we encounter states in successors with symbolic instruction pointers, we compute all possible concrete solutions (up to an arbitrary threshold of 256) for them, and make a copy of the state for each such solution. We call this process \"flattening\". These flat_successors are states, each of which has a different, concrete instruction pointer. For example, if the instruction pointer of a state in successors was X+5, where X had constraints of X > 0x800000 and X , we would flatten it into 16 different flat_successors states, one with an instruction pointer of 0x800006, one with 0x800007, and so on until 0x800015.\n\n\nunconstrained_successors\nTrue (can be symbolic, but constrained to True).\nSymbolic (with more than 256 solutions).\nDuring the flattening procedure described above, if it turns out that there are more than 256 possible solutions for the instruction pointer, we assume that the instruction pointer has been overwritten with unconstrained data (i.e., a stack overflow with user data). This assumption is not sound in general. Such states are placed in unconstrained_successors and not in successors.\n\n\nall_successors\nAnything\nCan be symbolic.\nThis is successors + unsat_successors + unconstrained_successors.\n\n\n\nBreakpoints\nTODO: rewrite this to fix the narrative\nLike any decent execution engine, angr supports breakpoints. This is pretty cool! A point is set as follows:\n>>> import angr\n>>> b = angr.Project('examples/fauxware/fauxware')\n\n# get our state\n>>> s = b.factory.entry_state()\n\n# add a breakpoint. This breakpoint will drop into ipdb right before a memory write happens.\n>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write')\n\n# on the other hand, we can have a breakpoint trigger right *after* a memory write happens. \n# we can also have a callback function run instead of opening ipdb.\n>>> def debug_func(state):\n...     print(\"State %s is about to do a memory write!\")\n\n>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', when=angr.BP_AFTER, action=debug_func)\n\n# or, you can have it drop you in an embedded IPython!\n>>> s.inspect.b('mem_write', when=angr.BP_AFTER, action=angr.BP_IPYTHON)\n\nThere are many other places to break than a memory write.

In fact, we can even specify a function as a condition:\n# this is a complex condition that could do anything!

If you are using breakpoint on mem_read and also using state.mem to load data from memory addresses, then know that the breakpoint will be fired as you are technically reading memory.  \nSo if you want to load data from memory and not trigger any mem_read breakpoint you have had set up, then use state.memory.load with the keyword arguments disable_actions=True and inspect=False. \nThis is also true for state.find and you can use the same keyword arguments to prevent mem_read breakpoints from firing.\n"},"docs/analyses.html":{"url":"docs/analyses.html","title":"Analyses","keywords":"","body":"Analyses\nangr's goal is to make it easy to carry out useful analyses on binary programs.\nTo this end, angr allows you to package analysis code in a common format that can be easily applied to any project.\nWe will cover writing your own analyses later, but the idea is that all the analyses appear under project.analyses (for example, project.analyses.CFGFast()) and can be called as functions, returning analysis result instances.\nBuilt-in Analyses\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCFGFast\nConstructs a fast Control Flow Graph of the program\n\n\nCFGEmulated\nConstructs an accurate Control Flow Graph of the program\n\n\nVFG\nPerforms VSA on every function of the program, creating a Value Flow Graph and detecting stack variables\n\n\nDDG\nCalculates a Data Dependency Graph, allowing one to determine what statements a given value depends on\n\n\nBackwardSlice\nComputes a Backward Slice of a program with respect to a certain target\n\n\nIdentifier\nIdentifies common library functions in CGC binaries\n\n\nMore!\nangr has quite a few analyses, most of which work!

While it is theoretically more accurate, it is dramatically slower.\nIt is also typically less complete, due to issues with the accuracy of emulation (system calls, missing hardware features, and so on)\nIf you are unsure which CFG to use, or are having problems with CFGEmulated, try CFGFast first.\nA CFG can be constructed by doing:\n>>> import angr\n# load your project\n>>> p = angr.Project('/bin/true', load_options={'auto_load_libs': False})\n\n# Generate a static CFG\n>>> cfg = p.analyses.CFGFast()\n\n# generate a dynamic CFG\n>>> cfg = p.analyses.CFGEmulated(keep_state=True)\n\nUsing the CFG\nThe CFG, at its core, is a NetworkX di-graph.\nThis means that all of the normal NetworkX APIs are available:\n>>> print(\"This is the graph:\", cfg.graph)\n>>> print(\"It has %d nodes and %d edges\" % (len(cfg.graph.nodes()), len(cfg.graph.edges())))\n\nThe nodes of the CFG graph are instances of class CFGNode.\nDue to context sensitivity, a given basic block can have multiple nodes in the graph (for multiple contexts).\n# this grabs *any* node at a given location:\n>>> entry_node = cfg.get_any_node(p.entry)\n\n# on the other hand, this grabs all of the nodes\n>>> print(\"There were %d contexts for the entry block\" % len(cfg.get_all_nodes(p.entry)))\n\n# we can also look up predecessors and successors\n>>> print(\"Predecessors of the entry point:\", entry_node.predecessors)\n>>> print(\"Successors of the entry point:\", entry_node.successors)\n>>> print(\"Successors (and type of jump) of the entry point:\", [ jumpkind + \" to \" + str(node.addr) for node,jumpkind in cfg.get_successors_and_jumpkind(entry_node) ])\n\nViewing the CFG\nControl-flow graph rendering is a hard problem.\nangr does not provide any built-in mechanism for rendering the output of a CFG analysis, and attempting to use a traditional graph rendering library, like matplotlib, will result in an unusable image.\nOne solution for viewing angr CFGs is found in axt's angr-utils repository.\nShared Libraries\nThe CFG analysis does not distinguish between code from different binary objects.\nThis means that by default, it will try to analyze control flow through loaded shared libraries.\nThis is almost never intended behavior, since this will extend the analysis time to several days, probably.\nTo load a binary without shared libraries, add the following keyword argument to the Project constructor:\nload_options={'auto_load_libs': False}\nFunction Manager\nThe CFG result produces an object called the Function Manager, accessible through cfg.kb.functions.\nThe most common use case for this object is to access it like a dictionary. It maps addresses to Function objects, which can tell you properties about a function.\n>>> entry_func = cfg.kb.functions[p.entry]\n\nFunctions have several important properties!\n\nentry_func.block_addrs is a set of addresses at which basic blocks belonging to the function begin.\nentry_func.blocks is the set of basic blocks belonging to the function, that you can explore and disassemble using capstone.\nentry_func.string_references() returns a list of all the constant strings that were referred to at any point in the function.\nThey are formatted as (addr, string) tuples, where addr is the address in the binary's data section the string lives, and string is a python string that contains the value of the string.\nentry_func.returning is a boolean value signifying whether or not the function can return.\nFalse indicates that all paths do not return.\nentry_func.callable is an angr Callable object referring to this function.\nYou can call it like a python function with python arguments and get back an actual result (may be symbolic) as if you ran the function with those arguments!\nentry_func.transition_graph is a NetworkX DiGraph describing control flow within the function itself. It resembles the control-flow graphs IDA displays on a per-function level.\nentry_func.name is the name of the function.\nentry_func.has_unresolved_calls and entry.has_unresolved_jumps have to do with detecting imprecision within the CFG.\nSometimes, the analysis cannot detect what the possible target of an indirect call or jump could be.\nIf this occurs within a function, that function will have the appropriate has_unresolved_* value set to True.\nentry_func.get_call_sites() returns a list of all the addresses of basic blocks which end in calls out to other functions.\nentry_func.get_call_target(callsite_addr) will, given callsite_addr from the list of call site addresses, return where that callsite will call out to.\nentry_func.get_call_return(callsite_addr) will, given callsite_addr from the list of call site addresses, return where that callsite should return to.\n\nand many more !\nCFGFast details\nCFGFast peforms a static control-flow and function recovery.\nStarting with the entry point (or any user-defined points) roughly the following procedure is performed:\n1) The basic block is lifted to VEX IR, and all its exits (jumps, calls, returns, or continuation to the next block) are collected\n2) For each exit, if this exit is a constant address, we add an edge to the CFG of the correct type, and add the destination block to the set of blocks to be analyzed.\n3) In the event of a function call, the destination block is also considered the start of a new function. If the target function is known to return, the block after the call is also analyzed.\n4) In the event of a return, the current function is marked as returning, and the appropriate edges in the callgraph and CFG are updated.\n4) For all indirect jumps (block exits with a non-constant destination) Indirect Jump Resolution is performed.\nFinding function starts\nCFGFast supports multiple ways of deciding where a function starts and ends.\nFirst the binary's main entry point will be analyzed.\nFor binaries with symbols (e.g., non-stripped ELF and PE binaries) all function symbols will be used as possible starting points.\nFor binaries without symbols, such as stripped binaries, or binaries loaded using the blob loader backend, CFG will scan the binary for a set of function prologues defined for the binary's architecture.\nFinally, by default, the binary's entire code section will be scanned for executable contents, regardless of prologues or symbols.\nIn addition to these, as with CFGEmulated, function starts will also be considered when they are the target of a \"call\" instruction on the given architecture.\nAll of these options can be disabled\nFakeRets and function returns\nWhen a function call is observed, we first assume that the callee function eventually returns, and treat the block after it as part of the caller function.\nThis inferred control-flow edge is known as a \"FakeRet\".\nIf, in analyzing the callee, we find this not to be true, we update the CFG, removing this \"FakeRet\", and updating the callgraph and function blocks accordingly.\nAs such, the CFG is recovered twice.  In doing this, the set of blocks in each function, and whether the function returns, can be recovered and propagated directly.\nIndirect Jump Resolution\nTODO\nOptions\nThese are the most useful options when working with CFGFast:\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nforce_complete_scan\n(Default: True) Treat the entire binary as code for the purposes of function detection.

This has the drawback of likely leading to a path explosion, unless you are very careful about constraining the input to the function in question. The path explosion can be partially mitigated with other angr capabilities (such as Veritesting).\nReplace the SimProcedure with something written directly to the situation in question. For example, our scanf implementation is not complete, but if you just need to support a single, known format string, you can write a hook to do exactly that.\nFix the SimProcedure.\n\nUnsupported syscalls\nSystem calls are also implemented as SimProcedures.\nUnfortunately, there are system calls that we have not yet implemented in angr.\nThere are several workarounds for an unsupported system call:\n\nImplement the system call. TODO: document this process\nHook the callsite of the system call (using project.hook) to make the required modifications to the state in an ad-hoc way.\nUse the state.posix.queued_syscall_returns list to queue syscall return values. If a return value is queued, the system call will not be executed, and the value will be used instead. Furthermore, a function can be queued instead as the \"return value\", which will result in that function being applied to the state when the system call is triggered.\n\nSymbolic memory model\nThe default memory model used by angr is inspired by Mayhem.\nThis memory model supports limited symbolic reads and writes.\nIf the memory index of a read is symbolic and the range of possible values of this index is too wide, the index is concretized to a single value.\nIf the memory index of a write is symbolic at all, the index is concretized to a single value.\nThis is configurable by changing the memory concretization strategies of state.memory.\nSymbolic lengths\nSimProcedures, and especially system calls such as read() and write() might run into a situation where the length of a buffer is symbolic.\nIn general, this is handled very poorly: in many cases, this length will end up being concretized outright or retroactively concretized in later steps of execution.\nEven in cases when it is not, the source or destination file might end up looking a bit \"weird\".\n"},"docs/pipeline.html":{"url":"docs/pipeline.html","title":"The Whole Pipeline","keywords":"","body":"Understanding the Execution Pipeline\nIf you've made it this far you know that at its core, angr is a highly flexible and intensely instrumentable emulator.\nIn order to get the most mileage out of it, you'll want to know what happens at every step of the way when you say simgr.run().\nThis is intended to be a more advanced document; you'll need to understand the function and intent of SimulationManager, ExplorationTechnique, SimState, and SimEngine in order to understand what we're talking about at times!\nYou may want to have the angr source open to follow along with this.\nAt every step along the way, each function will take **kwargs and pass them along to the next function in the hierarchy, so you can pass parameters to any point in the hierarchy and they will trickle down to everything below.\nSimulation Managers\nSo you've set your analysis in motion. Time to begin our journey.\nrun()\nSimulationManager.run() takes several optional parameters, all of which control when to break out of the stepping loop.\nNotably, n, and until.\nn is used immediately - the run function loops, calling the step() function and passing on all its parameters until either n steps have happened or some other termination condition has occurred. If n is not provided, it defaults to 1, unless an until function is provided, in which case there will be no numerical cap on the loop.\nAdditionally, the stash that is being used is taken into consideration, as if it becomes empty execution must terminate.\nSo, in summary, when you call run(), step() will be called in a loop until any of the following:\n\nThe n number of steps have elapsed\nThe until function returns true\nThe exploration techniques complete() hooks (combined via the SimulationManager.completion_mode parameter/attribute - it is by default the any builtin function but can be changed to all for example) indicate that the analysis is complete\nThe stash being executed becomes empty\n\nAn aside: explore()\nSimulationManager.explore() is a very thin wrapper around run() which adds the Explorer exploration technique, since performing one-off explorations is a very common action.\nIts code in its entirety is below:\nnum_find += len(self._stashes[find_stash]) if find_stash in self._stashes else 0\ntech = self.use_technique(Explorer(find, avoid, find_stash, avoid_stash, cfg, num_find))\n\ntry:\n    self.run(stash=stash, n=n, **kwargs)\nfinally:\n    self.remove_technique(tech)\n\nreturn self\nExploration technique hooking\nFrom here down, every function in the simulation manager can be instrumented by an exploration technique.\nThe exact mechanism through which this works is that when you call SimulationManager.use_technique(), angr monkeypatches the simulation manager to replace any function implemented in the exploration technique's body with a function which will first call the exploration technique's function, and then on the second call will call the original function.\nThis is somewhat messy to implement and certainly not thread safe by any means, but does produce a clean and powerful interface for exploration techniques to instrument stepping behavior, either before or after the original function is called, even choosing whether or not to call the original function whatsoever.\nAdditionally, it allows multiple exploration techniques to hook the same function, as the monkeypatched function simply becomes the \"original\" function for the next-applied hook.\nstep()\nThere is a lot of complicated logic in step() to handle degenerate cases - mostly implementing the population of the deadended stash, the save_unsat option, and calling the filter() exploration technique hooks.\nBeyond this, though, most of the logic is looping through the stash specified by the stash argument and calling step_state() on each state, then applying the dict result of step_state() to the stash list.\nFinally, if the step_func parameter is provided, it is called with the simulation manager as a parameter before the step ends.\nstep_state()\nThe default step_state(), which can be overridden or instrumented by exploration techniques, is also simple - it calls successors(), which returns a SimSuccessors object, and then translates it into a dict mapping stash names to new states which should be added to that stash.\nIt also implements error handling - if successors() throws an error, it will be caught and an ErrorRecord will be inserted into SimulationManager.errored.\nsuccessors()\nWe've almost made it out of SimulationManager.\nsuccessors(), which can also be instrumented by exploration techniques, is supposed to take a state and step it forward, returning a SimSuccessors object categorizing its successors independently of any stash logic.\nIf the successor_func parameter was provided, it is used and its return value is returned directly.\nIf this parameter was not provided, we use the project.factory.successors method to tick the state forward and get our SimSuccessors.\nThe Engine\nWhen we get to the actual successors generation, we need to figure out how to actually perform the execution.\nHopefully, the angr documentation has been organized in a way such that by the time you reach this page, you know that a SimEngine is a device that knows how to take a state and produce its successors.\nThere is only one \"default engine\" per project, but you can provide the engine parameter to specify which engine will be used to perform the step.\nKeep in mind that this parameter can be provided way at the top, to .step(), .explore(), .run() or anything else that starts execution, and they will be filtered down to this level.\nAny additional parameters will continue being passed down, until they reach the part of the engine they are intended for.\nThe engine will discard any parameters it doesn't understand.\nGenerally, the main entry point of an engine is SimEngine.process(), which can return whatever result it likes, but for simulation managers, engines are required to use SuccessorsMixin, which provides a process() method, which creates a SimSuccessors object and then calls process_successors() so that other mixins can fill it out.\nangr's default engine, the UberEngine, contains several mixins which provide the process_successors() method:\n\nSimEngineFailure - handles stepping states with degenerate jumpkinds\nSimEngineSyscall - handles stepping states which have performed a syscall and need it executed\nHooksMixin - handles stepping states which have reached a hooked address and need the hook executed\nSimEngineUnicorn - executes machine code via the unicorn engine\nSootMixin - executes java bytecode via the SOOT IR\nHeavyVEXMixin - executes machine code via the VEX IR\n\nEach of these mixins is implemented to fill out the SimSuccessors object if they can handle the current state, otherwise they call super() to pass the job on to the next class in the stack. \nEngine mixins\nSimEngineFailure handles error cases. \nIt is only used when the previous jumpkind is one of Ijk_EmFail, Ijk_MapFail, Ijk_Sig*, Ijk_NoDecode (but only if the address is not hooked), or Ijk_Exit.\nIn the first four cases, its action is to raise an exception.\nIn the last case, its action is to simply produce no successors.\nSimEngineSyscall services syscalls.\nIt is used when the previous jumpkind is anything of the form Ijk_Sys*.\nIt works by making a call into SimOS to retrieve the SimProcedure that should be run to respond to this syscall, and then running it! Pretty simple.\nHooksMixin provides the hooking functionality in angr.\nIt is used when a state is at an address that is hooked, and the previous jumpkind is not Ijk_NoHook.\nIt simply looks up the associated SimProcedure and runs it on the state!\nIt also takes the parameter procedure, which will cause the given procedure to be run for the current step even if the address is not hooked.\nSimEngineUnicorn performs concrete execution with the Unicorn Engine.\nIt is used when the state option o.UNICORN is enabled, and a myriad of other conditions designed for maximum efficiency (described below) are met.\nSootMixin performs execution over the SOOT IR. Not very important unless you are analyzing java bytecode, in which case it is very important.\nSimEngineVEX is the big fellow.\nIt is used whenever any of the previous can't be used.\nIt attempts to lift bytes from the current address into an IRSB, and then executes that IRSB symbolically.\nThere are a huge number of parameters that can control this process, so I will merely link to the API reference describing them.\nThe exact process by which SimEngineVEX digs into an IRSB is a little complicated, but essentially it runs all the block's statements in order.\nThis code is worth reading if you want to see the true inner core of angr's symbolic execution.\nWhen using Unicorn Engine\nIf you add the o.UNICORN state option, at every step SimEngineUnicorn will be invoked, and try to see if it is allowed to use Unicorn to execute concretely.\nWhat you REALLY want to do is to add the predefined set o.unicorn (lowercase) of options to your state:\nunicorn = { UNICORN, UNICORN_SYM_REGS_SUPPORT, INITIALIZE_ZERO_REGISTERS, UNICORN_HANDLE_TRANSMIT_SYSCALL }\n\nThese will enable some additional functionalities and defaults which will greatly enhance your experience.\nAdditionally, there are a lot of options you can tune on the state.unicorn plugin.\nA good way to understand how unicorn works is by examining the logging output (logging.getLogger('angr.engines.unicorn_engine').setLevel('DEBUG'); logging.getLogger('angr.state_plugins.unicorn_engine').setLevel('DEBUG') from a sample run of unicorn.\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,012 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | started emulation at 0x4012f9 (1000000 steps)\nHere, angr diverts to unicorn engine, beginning with the basic block at 0x4012f9.\nThe maximum step count is set to 1000000, so if execution stays in Unicorn for 1000000 blocks, it'll automatically pop out.\nThis is to avoid hanging in an infinite loop.\nThe block count is configurable via the state.unicorn.max_steps variable.\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,014 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | mmap [0x401000, 0x401fff], 5 (symbolic)\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,016 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | mmap [0x7fffffffffe0000, 0x7fffffffffeffff], 3 (symbolic)\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,019 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | mmap [0x6010000, 0x601ffff], 3\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,022 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | mmap [0x602000, 0x602fff], 3 (symbolic)\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,023 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | mmap [0x400000, 0x400fff], 5\nINFO    | 2017-02-25 08:19:48,025 | angr.state_plugins.unicorn | mmap [0x7000000, 0x7000fff], 5\nangr performs lazy mapping of data that is accessed by unicorn engine, as it is accessed. 0x401000 is the page of instructions that it is executing, 0x7fffffffffe0000 is the stack, and so on.

Here's an example of the mixin pattern in action:\nclass Base:\n    def add_one(self, v):\n        return v + 1\n\nclass StringsMixin(Base):\n    def add_one(self, v):\n        coerce = type(v) is str\n        if coerce:\n            v = int(v)\n        result = super().add_one(v)\n        if coerce:\n            result = str(result)\n        return result\n\nclass ArraysMixin(Base):\n    def add_one(self, v):\n        if type(v) is list:\n            return [super().add_one(v_x) for v_x in v]\n        else:\n            return super().add_one(v)\n\nclass FinalClass(ArraysMixin, StringsMixin, Base):\n    pass\n\nWith this construction, we are able to define a very simple interface in the Base class, and by \"mixing in\" two mixins, we can create the FinalClass which has the same interface but with additional features.\nThis is accomplished through python's powerful multiple inheritance model, which handles method dispatch by creating a method resolution order, or MRO, which is unsuprisingly a list which determines the order in which methods are called as execution proceeds through super() calls.\nYou can view a class' MRO as such:\nFinalClass.__mro__\n\n(FinalClass, ArraysMixin, StringsMixin, Base, object)\n\nThis means that when we take an instance of FinalClass and call add_one(), python first checks to see if FinalClass defines an add_one, and then ArraysMixin, and so on and so forth.\nFurthermore, when ArraysMixin calls super().add_one(), python will skip past ArraysMixin in the MRO, first checking if StringsMixin defines an add_one, and so forth.\nBecause multiple inheritance can create strange dependency graphs in the subclass relationship, there are rules for generating the MRO and for determining if a given mix of mixins is even allowed. This is important to understand when building complex classes with many mixins which have dependencies on each other.\nIn short: left-to-right, depth-first, but deferring any base classes which are shared by multiple subclasses (the merge point of a diamond pattern in the inheritance graph) until the last point where they would be encountered in this depth-first search.\nFor example, if you have classes A, B(A), C(B), D(A), E(C, D), then the method resolution order will be E, C, B, D, A.\nIf there is any case in which the MRO would be ambiguous, the class construction is illegal and will throw an exception at import time.\nThis is complicated! If you find yourself confused, the canonical document explaining the rationale, history, and mechanics of python's multiple inheritence can be found here.\nMixins in Claripy Solvers\nyan please write something here\nMixins in angr Engines\nThe main entry point to a SimEngine is process(), but how do we determine what that does?\nThe mixin model is used in SimEngine and friends in order to allow pieces of functionality to be reused between static and symbolic analyses.\nThe default engine, UberEngine, is defined as follows:\nclass UberEngine(SimEngineFailure, SimEngineSyscall, HooksMixin, SimEngineUnicorn, SuperFastpathMixin, TrackActionsMixin, SimInspectMixin, HeavyResilienceMixin, SootMixin, HeavyVEXMixin):\n    pass\n\nEach of these mixins provides either execution through a different medium or some additional instrumentation feature.\nThough they are not listed here explicitly, there are some base classes implicit to this hierarchy which set up the way this class is traversed.\nMost of these mixins inherit from SuccessorsMixin, which is what provides the basic process() implementation.\nThis function sets up the SimSuccessors for the rest of the mixins to fill in, and then calls process_successors(), which each of the mixins which provide some mode of execution implement.\nIf the mixin can handle the step, it does so and returns, otherwise it calls super().process_successors().\nIn this way, the MRO for the engine class determines what the order of precedence for the engine's pieces is.\nHeavyVEXMixin and friends\nLet's take a closer look at the last mixin, HeavyVEXMixin.\nIf you look at the module hierarchy of the angr engines submodule, you will see that the vex submodule has a lot of pieces in it which are organized by how tightly tied to particular state types or data types they are.\nThe heavy VEX mixin is one version of the culmination of all of these.\nLet's look at its definition:\nclass HeavyVEXMixin(SuccessorsMixin, ClaripyDataMixin, SimStateStorageMixin, VEXMixin, VEXLifter):\n    ...\n    # a WHOLE lot of implementation\n\nSo, the heavy VEX mixin is meant to provide fully instrumented symbolic execution on a SimState.\nWhat does this entail? The mixins tell the tale.\nFirst, the plain VEXMixin.\nThis mixin is designed to provide the barest-bones framework for processing a VEX block.\nTake a look at its source code.\nIts main purpose is to perform the preliminary digestion of the VEX IRSB and dispatch processing of it to methods which are provided by mixins - look at the methods which are either pass or return NotImplemented.\nNotice that absolutely none of its code makes any assumption whatsoever of what the type of state is or even what the type of the data words inside state are.\nThis job is delegated to other mixins, making the VEXMixin an appropriate base class for literally any analysis on VEX blocks.\nThe next-most interesting mixin is the ClaripyDataMixin, whose source code is here.\nThis mixin actually integrates the fact that we are executing over the domain of Claripy ASTs.\nIt does this by implementing some of the methods which are unimplemented in the VEXMixin, most importantly the ITE expression, all the operations, and the clean helpers.\nIn terms of what it looks like to actually touch the SimState, the SimStateStorageMixin provides the glue between the VEXMixin's interface for memory writes et al and SimState's interface for memory writes and such.\nIt is unremarkable, except for a small interaction between it and the ClaripyDataMixin.\nThe Claripy mixin also overrides the memory/register read/write functions, for the purpose of converting between the bitvector and floating-point types, since the vex interface expects to be able to load and store floats, but the SimState interface wants to load and store only bitvectors.\nBecause of this, the claripy mixin must come before the storage mixin in the MRO.\nThis is very much an interaction like the one in the add_one example at the start of this page - one mixin serves as a data filtering layer for another mixin.\nInstrumenting the data layer\nLet's turn our attention to a mixin which is not included in the HeavyVEXMixin but rather mixed into the UberEngine formula explicitly: the TrackActionsMixin.\nThis mixin implements \"SimActions\", which is angr parlance for dataflow tracking.\nAgain, look at the source code.\nThe way it does this is that it wraps and unwraps the data layer to pass around additional information about data flows.\nLook at how it instruments RdTmp, for instance.\nIt immediately super()-calls to the next method in the MRO, but instead of returning that data it returns a tuple of the data and its dependencies, which depending on whether you want temporary variables to be atoms in the dataflow model, will either be just the tmp which was read or the dependencies of the value written to that tmp.\nThis pattern continues for every single method that this mixin touches - any expression it receives must be unpacked into the expression and its dependencies, and any result must be packaged with its dependencies before it is returned.\nThis works because the mixin above it makes no assumptions about what data it is passing around, and the mixin below it never gets to see any dependencies whatsoever. In fact, there could be multiple mixins performing this kind of wrap-unwrap trick and they could all coexist peacefully!\nNote that a mixin which instruments the data layer in this way is obligated to override every single method which takes or returns an expression value, even if it doesn't perform any operation on the expression other than doing the wrapping and unwrapping.\nTo understand why, imagine that the mixin does not override the _handle_vex_const expression, so immediate value loads are not annotated with dependencies.\nThe expression value which will be returned from the mixin which does provide _handle_vex_const will not be a tuple of (expression, deps), it will just be the expression.\nImagine this execution is taking place in the context of a WrTmp(t0, Const(0)).\nThe const expression will be passed down to the WrTmp handler along with the identifier of the tmp to write to.\nHowever, since _handle_vex_stmt_WrTmp will be overridden by our mixin which touches the data layer, it expects to be passed the tuple including the deps, and so it will crash when trying to unpack the not-a-tuple value.\nIn this way, you can sort of imagine that a mixin which instruments the data layer in this way is actually creating a contract within python's nonexistent typesystem - you are guaranteed to receive back any types you return, but you must pass down any types you receive as return values from below.\nMixins in the memory model\naudrey please write something here. or fish, I'm not picky\n"},"docs/speed.html":{"url":"docs/speed.html","title":"Optimizing Symbolic Execution","keywords":"","body":"Optimization considerations\nThe performance of angr as an analysis tool or emulator is greatly handicapped by the fact that lots of it is written in python.\nRegardless, there are a lot of optimizations and tweaks you can use to make angr faster and lighter.\nGeneral speed tips\n\nUse pypy.\nPypy is an alternate python interpreter that performs optimized jitting of python code.\nIn our tests, it's a 10x speedup out of the box.\nOnly use the SimEngine mixins that you need. SimEngine uses a mixin model which allows you to add and remove features by constructing new classes. The default engine mixes in every possible features, and the consequence of that is that it is slower than it needs to be. Look at the definition for UberEngine (the default SimEngine), copy its declaration, and remove all the base classes which provide features you don't need.\nDon't load shared libraries unless you need them.\nThe default setting in angr is to try at all costs to find shared libraries that are compatible with the binary you've loaded, including loading them straight out of your OS libraries.\nThis can complicate things in a lot of scenarios.\nIf you're performing an analysis that's anything more abstract than bare-bones symbolic execution, ESPECIALLY control-flow graph construction, you might want to make the tradeoff of sacrificing accuracy for tractability.\nangr does a reasonable job of making sane things happen when library calls to functions that don't exist try to happen.\nUse hooking and SimProcedures.\nIf you're enabling shared libraries, then you definitely want to have SimProcedures written for any complicated library function you're jumping into.\nIf there's no autonomy requirement for this project, you can often isolate individual problem spots where analysis hangs up and summarize them with a hook.\nUse SimInspect.\nSimInspect is the most underused and one of the most powerful features of angr.\nYou can hook and modify almost any behavior of angr, including memory index resolution (which is often the slowest part of any angr analysis).\nWrite a concretization strategy.\nA more powerful solution to the problem of memory index resolution is a concretization strategy.\nUse the Replacement Solver.\nYou can enable it with the angr.options.REPLACEMENT_SOLVER state option.\nThe replacement solver allows you to specify AST replacements that are applied at solve-time.\nIf you add replacements so that all symbolic data is replaced with concrete data when it comes time to do the solve, the runtime is greatly reduced.\nThe API for adding a replacement is state.se._solver.add_replacement(old, new).\nThe replacement solver is a bit finicky, so there are some gotchas, but it'll definitely help.\n\nIf you're performing lots of concrete or partially-concrete execution\n\nUse the unicorn engine.\nIf you have unicorn engine installed, angr can be built to take advantage of it for concrete emulation.\nTo enable it, add the options in the set angr.options.unicorn to your state.\nKeep in mind that while most items under angr.options are individual options, angr.options.unicorn is a bundle of options, and is thus a set.\nNOTE: At time of writing the official version of unicorn engine will not work with angr - we have a lot of patches to it to make it work well with angr.\nThey're all pending pull requests at this time, so sit tight. If you're really impatient, ping us about uploading our fork!\nEnable fast memory and fast registers.\nThe state options angr.options.FAST_MEMORY and angr.options.FAST_REGISTERS will do this.\nThese will switch the memory/registers over to a less intensive memory model that sacrifices accuracy for speed.\nTODO: document the specific sacrifices. Should be safe for mostly concrete access though.\nNOTE: not compatible with concretization strategies.\nConcretize your input ahead of time.\nThis is the approach taken by driller.\nWhen creating a state with entry_state or the like, you can create a SimFile filled with symbolic data, pass it to the initialization function as an argument entry_state(..., stdin=my_simfile), and then constrain the symbolic data in the SimFile to what you want the input to be.\nIf you don't require any tracking of the data coming from stdin, you can forego the symbolic part and just fill it with concrete data.\nIf there are other sources of input besides standard input, do the same for those.\nUse the afterburner.\nWhile using unicorn, if you add the UNICORN_THRESHOLD_CONCRETIZATION state option, angr will accept thresholds after which it causes symbolic values to be concretized so that execution can spend more time in Unicorn. Specifically, the following thresholds exist:\n\nstate.unicorn.concretization_threshold_memory - this is the number of times a symbolic variable, stored in memory, is allowed to kick execution out of Unicorn before it is forcefully concretized and forced into Unicorn anyways.\nstate.unicorn.concretization_threshold_registers - this is the number of times a symbolic variable, stored in a register, is allowed to kick execution out of Unicorn before it is forcefully concretized and forced into Unicorn anyways.\nstate.unicorn.concretization_threshold_instruction - this is the number of times that any given instruction can force execution out of Unicorn (by running into symbolic data) before any symbolic data encountered at that instruction is concretized to force execution into Unicorn.\n\nYou can get further control of what is and isn't concretized with the following sets:\n\nstate.unicorn.always_concretize - a set of variable names that will always be concretized to force execution into unicorn (in fact, the memory and register thresholds just end up causing variables to be added to this list).\nstate.unicorn.never_concretize - a set of variable names that will never be concretized and forced into Unicorn under any condition.\nstate.unicorn.concretize_at - a set of instruction addresses at which data should be concretized and forced into Unicorn. The instruction threshold causes addresses to be added to this set.\n\nOnce something is concretized with the afterburner, you will lose track of that variable.\nThe state will still be consistent, but you'll lose dependencies, as the stuff that comes out of Unicorn is just concrete bits with no memory of what variables they came from.\nStill, this might be worth it for the speed in some cases, if you know what you want to (or do not want to) concretize.\n\n\nMemory optimization\nThe golden rule for memory optimization is to make sure you're not keeping any references to data you don't care about anymore, especially related to states which have been left behind.\nIf you find yourself running out of memory during analysis, the first thing you want to do is make sure you haven't caused a state explosion, meaning that the analysis is accumulating program states too quickly. If the state count is in control, then you can start looking for reference leaks. A good tool to do this with is https://github.com/rhelmot/dumpsterdiver, which gives you an interactive prompt for exploring the reference graph of a python process.\nOne specific consideration that should be made when analyzing programs with very long paths is that the state history is designed to accumulate data infinitely. This is less of a problem than it could be because the data is stored in a smart tree structure and never copied, but it will accumulate infinitely. To downsize a state's history and free all data related to old steps, call state.history.trim().\nOne particularly problematic member of the history dataset is the basic block trace and the stack pointer trace. When using unicorn engine, these lists of ints can become huge very very quickly. To disable unicorn's capture of ip and sp data, remove the state options UNICORN_TRACK_BBL_ADDRS and UNICORN_TRACK_STACK_POINTERS.\n"},"docs/file_system.html":{"url":"docs/file_system.html","title":"The Emulated Filesystem","keywords":"","body":"Working with File System, Sockets, and Pipes\nIt's very important to be able to control the environment that emulated programs see, including how symbolic data is introduced from the environment!\nangr has a robust series of abstractions to help you set up the environment you want.\nThe root of any interaction with the filesystem, sockets, pipes, or terminals is a SimFile object.\nA SimFile is a storage abstraction that defines a sequence of bytes, symbolic or otherwise.\nThere are several kinds of SimFiles which store their data very differently - the two easiest examples are SimFile (the base class is actually called SimFileBase), which stores files as a flat address-space of data, and SimPackets, which stores a sequence of variable-sized reads.\nThe former is best for modeling programs that need to perform seeks on their files, and is the default storage for opened files, while the latter is best for modeling programs that depend on short-reads or use scanf, and is the default storage for stdin/stdout/stderr.\nBecause SimFiles can have such diverse storage mechanisms, the interface for interacting with them is very abstracted.\nYou can read from the file from some position, you can write to the file at some position, you can ask how many bytes are currently stored in the file, and you can concretize the file, generating a testcase for it.\nIf you know specifically which SimFile class you're working with, you can take much more powerful control over it, and as a result you're encouraged to manually create any files you want to work with when you create your initial state.\nSpecifically, each SimFile class creates its own abstraction of a \"position\" within the file - each read and write takes a position and returns a new position that you should use to continue from where you left off.\nIf you're working with SimFiles of unknown type you have to treat this position as a totally opaque object with no semantics other than the contract with the read/write functions.\nHowever! This is a very poor match to how programs generally interact with files, so angr also has a SimFileDescriptor abstraction, which provides the familiar read/write/seek/tell interfaces but will also return error conditions when the underlying storage don't support the appropriate operations - just like normal file descriptors!\nYou may access the mapping from file descriptor number to file descriptor object in state.posix.fd.\nThe file descriptor API may be found here.\nJust tell me how to do what I want to do!\nOkay okay!!\nTo create a SimFile, you should just create an instance of the class you want to use.\nRefer to the API docs for the full instructions.\nLet's go through a few illustrative examples, which cover how you can work with a concrete file, a symbolic file, a file with mixed concrete and symbolic content, or streams.\nExample 1: Create a file with concrete content\n>>> import angr\n>>> simfile = angr.SimFile('myconcretefile', content='hello world!\\n')\n\nHere's a nuance - you can't use SimFiles without a state attached, because reasons.\nYou'll never have to do this in a real scenario (this operation happens automatically when you pass a SimFile into a constructor or the filesystem) but let's mock it up:\n>>> proj = angr.Project('/bin/true')\n>>> state = proj.factory.blank_state()\n>>> simfile.set_state(state)\n\nTo demonstrate the behavior of these files we're going to use the fact that the default SimFile position is just the number of bytes from the start of the file. SimFile.read returns a tuple (bitvector data, actual size, new pos):\n>>> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(0, 5)\n>>> import claripy\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(data == 'hello')\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(actual_size == 5)\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(new_pos == 5)\n\nContinue the read, trying to read way too much:\n>>> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(new_pos, 1000)\n\nangr doesn't try to sanitize the data returned, only the size - we returned 1000 bytes!\nThe intent is that you're only allowed to use up to actual_size of them.\n>>> assert len(data) == 1000*8  # bitvector sizes are in bits\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(actual_size == 8)\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(data.get_bytes(0, 8) == ' world!\\n')\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(new_pos == 13)\n\nExample 2: Create a file with symbolic content and a defined size\n>>> simfile = angr.SimFile('mysymbolicfile', size=0x20)\n>>> simfile.set_state(state)\n\n>>> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(0, 0x30)\n>>> assert data.symbolic\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(actual_size == 0x20)\n\nThe basic SimFile provides the same interface as state.memory, so you can load data directly:\n>>> assert simfile.load(0, actual_size) is data.get_bytes(0, 0x20)\n\nExample 3: Create a file with constrained symbolic content\n>>> bytes_list = [claripy.BVS('byte_%d' % i, 8) for i in range(32)]\n>>> bytes_ast = claripy.Concat(*bytes_list)\n>>> mystate = proj.factory.entry_state(stdin=angr.SimFile('/dev/stdin', content=bytes_ast))\n>>> for byte in bytes_list:\n...     mystate.solver.add(byte >= 0x20)\n...     mystate.solver.add(byte \nExample 4: Create a file with some mixed concrete and symbolic content, but no EOF\n>>> variable = claripy.BVS('myvar', 10*8)\n>>> simfile = angr.SimFile('mymixedfile', content=variable.concat(claripy.BVV('\\n')), has_end=False)\n>>> simfile.set_state(state)\n\nWe can always query the number of bytes stored in the file:\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(simfile.size == 11)\n\nReads will generate additional symbolic data past the current frontier:\n>>> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(0, 15)\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(actual_size == 15)\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(new_pos == 15)\n\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(data.get_bytes(0, 10) == variable)\n>>> assert claripy.is_true(data.get_bytes(10, 1) == '\\n')\n>>> assert data.get_bytes(11, 4).symbolic\n\nExample 5: Create a file with a symbolic size (has_end is implicitly true here)\n>>> symsize = claripy.BVS('mysize', 64)\n>>> state.solver.add(symsize >= 10)\n>>> state.solver.add(symsize >> simfile = angr.SimFile('mysymsizefile', size=symsize)\n>>> simfile.set_state(state)\n\nReads will encode all possibilities:\n>>> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(0, 30)\n>>> assert set(state.solver.eval_upto(actual_size, 30)) == set(range(10, 20))\n\nThe maximum size can't be easily resolved, so the data returned is 30 bytes long, and we're supposed to use it conjunction with actual_size.\n>>> assert len(data) == 30*8\n\nSymbolic read sizes work too!\n>>> symreadsize = claripy.BVS('myreadsize', 64)\n>>> state.solver.add(symreadsize >= 5)\n>>> state.solver.add(symreadsize >> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(0, symreadsize)\n\nAll sizes between 5 and 20 should be possible:\n>>> assert set(state.solver.eval_upto(actual_size, 30)) == set(range(5, 20))\n\nExample 6: Working with streams (SimPackets)\nSo far, we've only used the SimFile class, which models a random-accessible file object.\nHowever, in real life, files are not everything.\nStreams (standard I/O, TCP, etc.) are a great example:\nWhile they hold data like a normal file does, they do not support random accesses, e.g., you cannot read out the second byte of stdin if you have already read passed that position, and you cannot modify any byte that has been previously sent out to a network endpoint.\nThis allows us to design a simpler abstraction for streams in angr.\nBelieve it or not, this simpler abstraction for streams will benefit symbolic execution.\nConsider an example program that calls scanf N times to read in N strings.\nWith a traditional SimFile, as we do not know the length of each input string, there does not exist any clear boundary in the file between these symbolic input strings.\nIn this case, angr will perform N symbolic reads where each read will generate a gigantic tree of claripy ASTs, with string lengths being symbolic.\nThis is a nightmare for constraint solving.\nNevertheless, the fact that scanf is used on a stream (stdin) dictates that there will be zero overlap between individual reads, regardless of the sizes of each symbolic input string.\nWe may as well model stdin as a stream that comprises of consecutive packets, instead of a file containing a sequence of bytes.\nEach of the packet can be of a fixed length or a symbolic length.\nSince there will be absolutely no byte overlap between packets, the constraints that angr will produce after executing this example program will be a lot simpler.\nThe key concept involved is \"short reads\", i.e. when you ask for n bytes but actually get back fewer bytes than that.\nWe use a different class implementing SimFileBase, SimPackets, to automatically enable support for short reads.\nBy default, stdin, stdout, and stderr are all SimPackets objects.\n>>> simfile = angr.SimPackets('mypackets')\n>>> simfile.set_state(state)\n\nThis'll just generate a single packet.\nFor SimPackets, the position is just a packet number!\nIf left unspecified, short_reads is determined from a state option.\n>>> data, actual_size, new_pos = simfile.read(0, 20, short_reads=True)\n>>> assert len(data) == 20*8\n>>> assert set(state.solver.eval_upto(actual_size, 30)) == set(range(21))\n\nData in a SimPackets is stored as tuples of (packet data, packet size) in .content.\n>>> print(simfile.content)\n[(, )]\n\n>>> simfile.read(0, 1, short_reads=False)\n>>> print(simfile.content)\n[(, ), (, )]\n\nSo hopefully you understand sort of the kind of data that a SimFile can store and what'll happen when a program tries to interact with it with various combinations of symbolic and concrete data.\nThose examples only covered reads, but writes are pretty similar.\nThe filesystem, for real now\nIf you want to make a SimFile available to the program, we need to either stick it in the filesystem or serve stdin/stdout from it.\nThe simulated filesystem is the state.fs plugin.\nYou can store, load, and delete files from the filesystem, with the insert, get, and delete methods.\nRefer to the api docs for details.\nSo to make our file available as /tmp/myfile:\n>>> state.fs.insert('/tmp/myfile', simfile)\n>>> assert state.fs.get('/tmp/myfile') is simfile\n\nThen, after execution, we would extract the file from the result state and use simfile.concretize() to generate a testcase to reach that state.\nKeep in mind that concretize() returns different types depending on the file type - for a SimFile it's a bytestring and for SimPackets it's a list of bytestrings.\nThe simulated filesystem supports a fun concept of \"mounts\", where you can designate a subtree as instrumented by a particular provider.\nThe most common mount is to expose a part of the host filesystem to the guest, lazily importing file data when the program asks for it:\n>>> state.fs.mount('/', angr.SimHostFilesystem('./guest_chroot'))\n\nYou can write whatever kind of mount you want to instrument filesystem access by subclassing angr.SimMount!\nStdio streams\nFor stdin and friends, it's a little more complicated.\nThe relevant plugin is state.posix, which stores all abstractions relevant to a POSIX-compliant environment.\nYou can always get a state's stdin SimFile with state.posix.stdin, but you can't just replace it - as soon as the state is created, references to this file are created in the file descriptors.\nBecause of this you need to specify it at the time the POSIX plugin is created:\n>>> state.register_plugin('posix', angr.state_plugins.posix.SimSystemPosix(stdin=simfile, stdout=simfile, stderr=simfile))\n>>> assert state.posix.stdin is simfile\n>>> assert state.posix.stdout is simfile\n>>> assert state.posix.stderr is simfile\n\nOr, there's a nice shortcut while creating the state if you only need to specify stdin:\n>>> state = proj.factory.entry_state(stdin=simfile)\n>>> assert state.posix.stdin is simfile\n\nAny of those places you can specify a SimFileBase, you can also specify a string or a bitvector (a flat SimFile with fixed size will be created to hold it) or a SimFile type (it'll be instantiated for you).\n"},"docs/ir.html":{"url":"docs/ir.html","title":"Intermediate Representation","keywords":"","body":"Intermediate Representation\nIn order to be able to analyze and execute machine code from different CPU architectures, such as MIPS, ARM, and PowerPC in addition to the classic x86, angr performs most of its analysis on an intermediate representation, a structured description of the fundamental actions performed by each CPU instruction.\nBy understanding angr's IR, VEX (which we borrowed from Valgrind), you will be able to write very quick static analyses and have a better understanding of how angr works.\nThe VEX IR abstracts away several architecture differences when dealing with different architectures, allowing a single analysis to be run on all of them:\n\nRegister names. The quantity and names of registers differ between architectures, but modern CPU designs hold to a common theme: each CPU contains several general purpose registers, a register to hold the stack pointer, a set of registers to store condition flags, and so forth. The IR provides a consistent, abstracted interface to registers on different platforms. Specifically, VEX models the registers as a separate memory space, with integer offsets (e.g., AMD64's rax is stored starting at address 16 in this memory space).\nMemory access. Different architectures access memory in different ways. For example, ARM can access memory in both little-endian and big-endian modes. The IR abstracts away these differences.\nMemory segmentation. Some architectures, such as x86, support memory segmentation through the use of special segment registers. The IR understands such memory access mechanisms.\nInstruction side-effects. Most instructions have side-effects. For example, most operations in Thumb mode on ARM update the condition flags, and stack push/pop instructions update the stack pointer. Tracking these side-effects in an ad hoc manner in the analysis would be crazy, so the IR makes these effects explicit.\n\nThere are lots of choices for an IR. We use VEX, since the uplifting of binary code into VEX is quite well supported.\nVEX is an architecture-agnostic, side-effects-free representation of a number of target machine languages.\nIt abstracts machine code into a representation designed to make program analysis easier.\nThis representation has four main classes of objects:\n\nExpressions. IR Expressions represent a calculated or constant value. This includes memory loads, register reads, and results of arithmetic operations.\nOperations. IR Operations describe a modification of IR Expressions. This includes integer arithmetic, floating-point arithmetic, bit operations, and so forth. An IR Operation applied to IR Expressions yields an IR Expression as a result.\nTemporary variables. VEX uses temporary variables as internal registers: IR Expressions are stored in temporary variables between use. The content of a temporary variable can be retrieved using an IR Expression. These temporaries are numbered, starting at t0. These temporaries are strongly typed (e.g., \"64-bit integer\" or \"32-bit float\").\nStatements. IR Statements model changes in the state of the target machine, such as the effect of memory stores and register writes. IR Statements use IR Expressions for values they may need. For example, a memory store IR Statement uses an IR Expression for the target address of the write, and another IR Expression for the content.\nBlocks. An IR Block is a collection of IR Statements, representing an extended basic block (termed \"IR Super Block\" or \"IRSB\") in the target architecture. A block can have several exits. For conditional exits from the middle of a basic block, a special Exit IR Statement is used. An IR Expression is used to represent the target of the unconditional exit at the end of the block.\n\nVEX IR is actually quite well documented in the libvex_ir.h file (https://github.com/angr/vex/blob/master/pub/libvex_ir.h) in the VEX repository. For the lazy, we'll detail some parts of VEX that you'll likely interact with fairly frequently. To begin with, here are some IR Expressions:\n\n\n\nIR Expression\nEvaluated Value\nVEX Output Example\n\n\n\n\nConstant\nA constant value.\n0x4:I32\n\n\nRead Temp\nThe value stored in a VEX temporary variable.\nRdTmp(t10)\n\n\nGet Register\nThe value stored in a register.\nGET:I32(16)\n\n\nLoad Memory\nThe value stored at a memory address, with the address specified by another IR Expression.\nLDle:I32 / LDbe:I64\n\n\nOperation\nA result of a specified IR Operation, applied to specified IR Expression arguments.\nAdd32\n\n\nIf-Then-Else\nIf a given IR Expression evaluates to 0, return one IR Expression. Otherwise, return another.\nITE\n\n\nHelper Function\nVEX uses C helper functions for certain operations, such as computing the conditional flags registers of certain architectures. These functions return IR Expressions.\nfunction_name()\n\n\n\nThese expressions are then, in turn, used in IR Statements. Here are some common ones:\n\n\n\nIR Statement\nMeaning\nVEX Output Example\n\n\n\n\nWrite Temp\nSet a VEX temporary variable to the value of the given IR Expression.\nWrTmp(t1) = (IR Expression)\n\n\nPut Register\nUpdate a register with the value of the given IR Expression.\nPUT(16) = (IR Expression)\n\n\nStore Memory\nUpdate a location in memory, given as an IR Expression, with a value, also given as an IR Expression.\nSTle(0x1000) = (IR Expression)\n\n\nExit\nA conditional exit from a basic block, with the jump target specified by an IR Expression. The condition is specified by an IR Expression.\nif (condition) goto (Boring) 0x4000A00:I32\n\n\n\nAn example of an IR translation, on ARM, is produced below. In the example, the subtraction operation is translated into a single IR block comprising 5 IR Statements, each of which contains at least one IR Expression (although, in real life, an IR block would typically consist of more than one instruction). Register names are translated into numerical indices given to the GET Expression and PUT Statement.\nThe astute reader will observe that the actual subtraction is modeled by the first 4 IR Statements of the block, and the incrementing of the program counter to point to the next instruction (which, in this case, is located at 0x59FC8) is modeled by the last statement.\nThe following ARM instruction:\nsubs R2, R2, #8\nBecomes this VEX IR:\nt0 = GET:I32(16)\nt1 = 0x8:I32\nt3 = Sub32(t0,t1)\nPUT(16) = t3\nPUT(68) = 0x59FC8:I32\nNow that you understand VEX, you can actually play with some VEX in angr: We use a library called PyVEX that exposes VEX into Python. In addition, PyVEX implements its own pretty-printing so that it can show register names instead of register offsets in PUT and GET instructions.\nPyVEX is accessable through angr through the Project.factory.block interface. There are many different representations you could use to access syntactic properties of a block of code, but they all have in common the trait of analyzing a particular sequence of bytes. Through the factory.block constructor, you get a Block object that can be easily turned into several different representations. Try .vex for a PyVEX IRSB, or .capstone for a Capstone block.\nLet's play with PyVEX:\n>>> import angr\n\n# load the program binary\n>>> proj = angr.Project(\"/bin/true\")\n\n# translate the starting basic block\n>>> irsb = proj.factory.block(proj.entry).vex\n# and then pretty-print it\n>>> irsb.pp()\n\n# translate and pretty-print a basic block starting at an address\n>>> irsb = proj.factory.block(0x401340).vex\n>>> irsb.pp()\n\n# this is the IR Expression of the jump target of the unconditional exit at the end of the basic block\n>>> print(irsb.next)\n\n# this is the type of the unconditional exit (e.g., a call, ret, syscall, etc)\n>>> print(irsb.jumpkind)\n\n# you can also pretty-print it\n>>> irsb.next.pp()\n\n# iterate through each statement and print all the statements\n>>> for stmt in irsb.statements:\n...     stmt.pp()\n\n# pretty-print the IR expression representing the data, and the *type* of that IR expression written by every store statement\n>>> import pyvex\n>>> for stmt in irsb.statements:\n...     if isinstance(stmt, pyvex.IRStmt.Store):\n...         print(\"Data:\",)\n...         stmt.data.pp()\n...         print(\"\")\n...         print(\"Type:\",)\n...         print(stmt.data.result_type)\n...         print(\"\")\n\n# pretty-print the condition and jump target of every conditional exit from the basic block\n>>> for stmt in irsb.statements:\n...     if isinstance(stmt, pyvex.IRStmt.Exit):\n...         print(\"Condition:\",)\n...         stmt.guard.pp()\n...         print(\"\")\n...         print(\"Target:\",)\n...         stmt.dst.pp()\n...         print(\"\")\n\n# these are the types of every temp in the IRSB\n>>> print(irsb.tyenv.types)\n\n# here is one way to get the type of temp 0\n>>> print(irsb.tyenv.types[0])\n\nCondition flags computation (for x86 and ARM)\nOne of the most common instruction side-effects on x86 and ARM CPUs is updating condition flags, such as the zero flag, the carry flag, or the overflow flag.\nComputer architects usually put the concatenation of these flags (yes, concatenation of the flags, since each condition flag is 1 bit wide) into a special register (i.e. EFLAGS/RFLAGS on x86, APSR/CPSR on ARM).\nThis special register stores important information about the program state, and is critical for correct emulation of the CPU.\nVEX uses 4 registers as its \"Flag thunk descriptors\" to record details of the latest flag-setting operation.\nVEX has a lazy strategy to compute the flags: when an operation that would update the flags happens, instead of computing the flags, VEX stores a code representing this operation to the cc_op pseudo-register, and the arguments to the operation in cc_dep1 and cc_dep2.\nThen, whenever VEX needs to get the actual flag values, it can figure out what the one bit corresponding to the flag in question actually is, based on its flag thunk descriptors.\nThis is an optimization in the flags computation, as VEX can now just directly perform the relevant operation in the IR without bothering to compute and update the flags' value.\nAmongst different operations that can be placed in cc_op, there is a special value 0 which corresponds to OP_COPY operation.\nThis operation is supposed to copy the value in cc_dep1 to the flags.\nIt simply means that cc_dep1 contains the flags' value.\nangr uses this fact to let us efficiently retrieve the flags' value: whenever we ask for the actual flags, angr computes their value, then dumps them back into cc_dep1 and sets cc_op = OP_COPY in order to cache the computation.\nWe can also use this operation to allow the user to write to the flags: we just set cc_op = OP_COPY to say that a new value being set to the flags, then set cc_dep1 to that new value.\n"},"docs/structured_data.html":{"url":"docs/structured_data.html","title":"Working with Data and Conventions","keywords":"","body":"Working with Data and Conventions\nFrequently, you'll want to access structured data from the program you're analyzing.\nangr has several features to make this less of a headache.\nWorking with types\nangr has a system for representing types.\nThese SimTypes are found in angr.types - an instance of any of these classes represents a type.\nMany of the types are incomplete unless they are supplamented with a SimState - their size depends on the architecture you're running under.\nYou may do this with ty.with_arch(arch), which returns a copy of itself, with the architecture specified.\nangr also has a light wrapper around pycparser, which is a C parser.\nThis helps with getting instances of type objects:\n>>> import angr, monkeyhex\n\n# note that SimType objects have their __repr__ defined to return their c type name,\n# so this function actually returned a SimType instance.\n>>> angr.types.parse_type('int')\nint\n\n>>> angr.types.parse_type('char **')\nchar**\n\n>>> angr.types.parse_type('struct aa {int x;

Any type may support any refinement it likes.\nRight now the only refinements supported are that you may access any member of a struct by its member name, and you may index into a string or array to access that element.\nIf the address you specified initially points to an array of that type, you can say .array(n) to view the data as an array of n elements.\nFinally, extract the structured data with .resolved or .concrete.\n.resolved will return bitvector values, while .concrete will return integer, string, array, etc values, whatever best represents the data.\nAlternately, you may store a value to memory, by assigning to the chain of properties that you've constructed.\nNote that because of the way python works, x = s.mem[...].prop; x = val will NOT work, you must say s.mem[...].prop = val.\n\nIf you define a struct using register_types(parse_type(struct_expr)), you can access it here as a type:\n>>> s.mem[b.entry].struct.abcd\n,\n  .y = \n} at 0x400580>\n\nWorking with Calling Conventions\nA calling convention is the specific means by which code passes arguments and return values through function calls.\nWhile angr comes with a large number of pre-built calling conventions, and a lot of logic for refining calling conventions for specific circumstances (e.g. floating point arguments need to be stored in different locations, it gets worse from there), it will inevitably be insufficient to describe all possible calling conventions a compiler could generate.\nBecause of this, you can customize a calling convention by describing where the arguments and return values should live.\nangr's abstraction of calling conventions is called SimCC.\nYou can construct new SimCC instances through the angr object factory, with b.factory.cc(...).\n\nPass as the args keyword argument a list of argument storage locations\nPass as the ret_val keyword argument the location where the return value should be stored\nPass as the func_ty keyword argument a SymType for the function prototype.\nPass it none of these things to use a sane default for the current architecture!\n\nTo specify a value location for the args or ret_val parameters, use instances of the SimRegArg or SimStackArg classes.\nYou can find them in the factory - b.factory.cc.Sim*Arg.\nRegister arguments should be instantiated with the name of the register you're storing the value in, and the size of the register in bytes.\nStack arguments should be instantiated with the offset from the stack pointer at the time of entry into the function and the size of the storage location, in bytes.\nOnce you have a SimCC object, you can use it along with a SimState object to extract or store function arguments more cleanly.\nTake a look at the API documentation for details.\nAlternately, you can pass it to an interface that can use it to modify its own behavior, like b.factory.call_state, or...\nCallables\n\nCallables are a Foreign Functions Interface (FFI) for symbolic execution.\nBasic callable usage is to create one with myfunc = b.factory.callable(addr), and then call it! result = myfunc(args, ...)\nWhen you call the callable, angr will set up a call_state at the given address, dump the given arguments into memory, and run a path_group based on this state until all the paths have exited from the function.\nThen, it merges all the result states together, pulls the return value out of that state, and returns it.\nAll the interaction with the state happens with the aid of a SimCC, to tell where to put the arguments and where to get the return value.\nBy default, it uses a sane default for the architecture, but if you'd like to customize it, you can pass a SimCC object in the cc keyword argument when constructing the callable.\nYou can pass symbolic data as function arguments, and everything will work fine.\nYou can even pass more complicated data, like strings, lists, and structures as native python data (use tuples for structures), and it'll be serialized as cleanly as possible into the state.\nIf you'd like to specify a pointer to a certain value, you can wrap it in a PointerWrapper object, available as b.factory.callable.PointerWrapper.\nThe exact semantics of how pointer-wrapping work are a little confusing, but they can be boiled down to \"unless you specify it with a PointerWrapper or a specific SimArrayType, nothing will be wrapped in a pointer automatically unless it gets to the end and it hasn't yet been wrapped in a pointer yet and the original type is a string, array, or tuple.\"\nThe relevant code is actually in SimCC - it's the setup_callsite function.\nIf you don't care for the actual return value of the call, you can say func.perform_call(arg, ...), and then the properties func.result_state and func.result_path_group will be populated.\nThey will actually be populated even if you call the callable normally, but you probably care about them more in this case!\n"},"docs/claripy.html":{"url":"docs/claripy.html","title":"Claripy","keywords":"","body":"Solver Engine\nangr's solver engine is called Claripy.\nClaripy exposes the following design:\n\nClaripy ASTs (the subclasses of claripy.ast.Base) provide a unified way to interact with concrete and symbolic expressions\nFrontends provide different paradigms for evaluating these expressions. For example, the FullFrontend solves expressions using something like an SMT solver backend, while LightFrontend handles them by using an abstract (and approximating) data domain backend.\nEach Frontend needs to, at some point, do actual operation and evaluations on an AST. ASTs don't support this on their own. Instead, Backends translate ASTs into backend objects (i.e., python primitives for BackendConcrete, Z3 expressions for BackendZ3, strided intervals for BackendVSA, etc) and handle any appropriate state-tracking objects (such as tracking the solver state in the case of BackendZ3). Roughly speaking, frontends take ASTs as inputs and use backends to backend.convert() those ASTs into backend objects that can be evaluated and otherwise reasoned about.\nFrontendMixins customize the operation of Frontends. For example, ModelCacheMixin caches solutions from an SMT solver.\nThe combination of a Frontend, a number of FrontendMixins, and a number of Backends comprise a claripy Solver.\n\nInternally, Claripy seamlessly mediates the co-operation of multiple disparate backends -- concrete bitvectors, VSA constructs, and SAT solvers. It is pretty badass.\nMost users of angr will not need to interact directly with Claripy (except for, maybe, claripy AST objects, which represent symbolic expressions) -- angr handles most interactions with Claripy internally.\nHowever, for dealing with expressions, an understanding of Claripy might be useful.\nClaripy ASTs\nClaripy ASTs abstract away the differences between mathematical constructs that Claripy supports.\nThey define a tree of operations (i.e., (a + b) / c) on any type of underlying data.\nClaripy handles the application of these operations on the underlying objects themselves by dispatching requests to the backends.\nCurrently, Claripy supports the following types of ASTs:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nSupported By (Claripy Backends)\nExample Code\n\n\n\n\nBV\nThis is a bitvector, whether symbolic (with a name) or concrete (with a value). It has a size (in bits).\nBackendConcrete, BackendVSA, BackendZ3\nCreate a 32-bit symbolic bitvector \"x\": `claripy.BVS('x', 32)`Create a 32-bit bitvector with the value `0xc001b3475`: `claripy.BVV(0xc001b3a75, 32)`Create a 32-bit \"strided interval\" (see VSA documentation) that can be any divisible-by-10 number between 1000 and 2000: `claripy.SI(name='x', bits=32, lower_bound=1000, upper_bound=2000, stride=10)`\n\n\nFP\nThis is a floating-point number, whether symbolic (with a name) or concrete (with a value).\nBackendConcrete, BackendZ3\nCreate a `claripy.fp.FSORT_DOUBLE` symbolic floating point \"b\": `claripy.FPS('b', claripy.fp.FSORT_DOUBLE)`Create a `claripy.fp.FSORT_FLOAT` floating point with value `3.2`: `claripy.FPV(3.2, claripy.fp.FSORT_FLOAT)`\n\n\nBool\nThis is a boolean operation (True or False).\nBackendConcrete, BackendVSA, BackendZ3\nclaripy.BoolV(True), or claripy.true or claripy.false, or by comparing two ASTs (i.e., claripy.BVS('x', 32) \n\n\n\nAll of the above creation code returns claripy.AST objects, on which operations can then be carried out.\nASTs provide several useful operations.\n>>> import claripy\n\n>>> bv = claripy.BVV(0x41424344, 32)\n\n# Size - you can get the size of an AST with .size()\n>>> assert bv.size() == 32\n\n# Reversing - .reversed is the reversed version of the BVV\n>>> assert bv.reversed is claripy.BVV(0x44434241, 32)\n>>> assert bv.reversed.reversed is bv\n\n# Depth - you can get the depth of the AST\n>>> print(bv.depth)\n>>> assert bv.depth == 1\n>>> x = claripy.BVS('x', 32)\n>>> assert (x+bv).depth == 2\n>>> assert ((x+bv)/10).depth == 3\n\nApplying a condition (==, !=, etc) on ASTs will return an AST that represents the condition being carried out.\nFor example:\n>>> r = bv == x\n>>> assert isinstance(r, claripy.ast.Bool)\n\n>>> p = bv == bv\n>>> assert isinstance(p, claripy.ast.Bool)\n>>> assert p.is_true()\n\nYou can combine these conditions in different ways.\n>>> q = claripy.And(claripy.Or(bv == x, bv * 2 == x, bv * 3 == x), x == 0)\n>>> assert isinstance(p, claripy.ast.Bool)\n\nThe usefulness of this will become apparent when we discuss Claripy solvers.\nIn general, Claripy supports all of the normal python operations (+, -, |, ==, etc), and provides additional ones via the Claripy instance object. Here's a list of available operations from the latter.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nLShR\nLogically shifts a bit expression (BVV, BV, SI) to the right.\nclaripy.LShR(x, 10)\n\n\nSignExt\nSign-extends a bit expression.\nclaripy.SignExt(32, x) or x.sign_extend(32)\n\n\nZeroExt\nZero-extends a bit expression.\nclaripy.ZeroExt(32, x) or x.zero_extend(32)\n\n\nExtract\nExtracts the given bits (zero-indexed from the right, inclusive) from a bit expression.\nExtract the rightmost byte of x: claripy.Extract(7, 0, x) or x[7:0]\n\n\nConcat\nConcatenates several bit expressions together into a new bit expression.\nclaripy.Concat(x, y, z)\n\n\nRotateLeft\nRotates a bit expression left.\nclaripy.RotateLeft(x, 8)\n\n\nRotateRight\nRotates a bit expression right.\nclaripy.RotateRight(x, 8)\n\n\nReverse\nEndian-reverses a bit expression.\nclaripy.Reverse(x) or x.reversed\n\n\nAnd\nLogical And (on boolean expressions)\nclaripy.And(x == y, x > 0)\n\n\nOr\nLogical Or (on boolean expressions)\nclaripy.Or(x == y, y \n\n\nNot\nLogical Not (on a boolean expression)\nclaripy.Not(x == y) is the same as x != y\n\n\nIf\nAn If-then-else\nChoose the maximum of two expressions: claripy.If(x > y, x, y)\n\n\nULE\nUnsigned less than or equal to.\nCheck if x is less than or equal to y: claripy.ULE(x, y)\n\n\nULT\nUnsigned less than.\nCheck if x is less than y: claripy.ULT(x, y)\n\n\nUGE\nUnsigned greater than or equal to.\nCheck if x is greater than or equal to y: claripy.UGE(x, y)\n\n\nUGT\nUnsigned greater than.\nCheck if x is greater than y: claripy.UGT(x, y)\n\n\nSLE\nSigned less than or equal to.\nCheck if x is less than or equal to y: claripy.SLE(x, y)\n\n\nSLT\nSigned less than.\nCheck if x is less than y: claripy.SLT(x, y)\n\n\nSGE\nSigned greater than or equal to.\nCheck if x is greater than or equal to y: claripy.SGE(x, y)\n\n\nSGT\nSigned greater than.\nCheck if x is greater than y: claripy.SGT(x, y)\n\n\n\nNOTE: The default python >, , >=, and  are unsigned in Claripy. This is different than their behavior in Z3, because it seems more natural in binary analysis.\nSolvers\nThe main point of interaction with Claripy are the Claripy Solvers.\nSolvers expose an API to interpret ASTs in different ways and return usable values.\nThere are several different solvers.\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSolver\nThis is analogous to a z3.Solver(). It is a solver that tracks constraints on symbolic variables and uses a constraint solver (currently, Z3) to evaluate symbolic expressions.\n\n\nSolverVSA\nThis solver uses VSA to reason about values. It is an approximating solver, but produces values without performing actual constraint solves.\n\n\nSolverReplacement\nThis solver acts as a pass-through to a child solver, allowing the replacement of expressions on-the-fly. It is used as a helper by other solvers and can be used directly to implement exotic analyses.\n\n\nSolverHybrid\nThis solver combines the SolverReplacement and the Solver (VSA and Z3) to allow for approximating values. You can specify whether or not you want an exact result from your evaluations, and this solver does the rest.\n\n\nSolverComposite\nThis solver implements optimizations that solve smaller sets of constraints to speed up constraint solving.\n\n\n\nSome examples of solver usage:\n# create the solver and an expression\n>>> s = claripy.Solver()\n>>> x = claripy.BVS('x', 8)\n\n# now let's add a constraint on x\n>>> s.add(claripy.ULT(x, 5))\n\n>>> assert sorted(s.eval(x, 10)) == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> assert s.max(x) == 4\n>>> assert s.min(x) == 0\n\n# we can also get the values of complex expressions\n>>> y = claripy.BVV(65, 8)\n>>> z = claripy.If(x == 1, x, y)\n>>> assert sorted(s.eval(z, 10)) == [1, 65]\n\n# and, of course, we can add constraints on complex expressions\n>>> s.add(z % 5 != 0)\n>>> assert s.eval(z, 10) == (1,)\n>>> assert s.eval(x, 10) == (1,) # interestingly enough, since z can't be y, x can only be 1!\n\nCustom solvers can be built by combining a Claripy Frontend (the class that handles the actual interaction with SMT solver or the underlying data domain) and some combination of frontend mixins (that handle things like caching, filtering out duplicate constraints, doing opportunistic simplification, and so on).\nClaripy Backends\nBackends are Claripy's workhorses.\nClaripy exposes ASTs to the world, but when actual computation has to be done, it pushes those ASTs into objects that can be handled by the backends themselves.\nThis provides a unified interface to the outside world while allowing Claripy to support different types of computation.\nFor example, BackendConcrete provides computation support for concrete bitvectors and booleans, BackendVSA introduces VSA constructs such as StridedIntervals (and details what happens when operations are performed on them, and BackendZ3 provides support for symbolic variables and constraint solving.\nThere are a set of functions that a backend is expected to implement.\nFor all of these functions, the \"public\" version is expected to be able to deal with claripy's AST objects, while the \"private\" version should only deal with objects specific to the backend itself.\nThis is distinguished with Python idioms: a public function will be named func() while a private function will be _func().\nAll functions should return objects that are usable by the backend in its private methods.\nIf this can't be done (i.e., some functionality is being attempted that the backend can't handle), the backend should raise a BackendError.\nIn this case, Claripy will move on to the next backend in its list.\nAll backends must implement a convert() function.\nThis function receives a claripy AST and should return an object that the backend can handle in its private methods.\nBackends should also implement a _convert() method, which will receive anything that is not a claripy AST object (i.e., an integer or an object from a different backend).\nIf convert() or _convert() receives something that the backend can't translate to a format that is usable internally, the backend should raise BackendError, and thus won't be used for that object.\nAll backends must also implement any functions of the base Backend abstract class that currently raise NotImplementedError().\nClaripy's contract with its backends is as follows: backends should be able to handle, in their private functions, any object that they return from their private or public functions.\nClaripy will never pass an object to any backend private function that did not originate as a return value from a private or public function of that backend.\nOne exception to this is convert() and _convert(), as Claripy can try to stuff anything it feels like into _convert() to see if the backend can handle that type of object.\nBackend Objects\nTo perform actual, useful computation on ASTs, Claripy uses backend objects.\nA BackendObject is a result of the operation represented by the AST.\nClaripy expects these objects to be returned from their respective backends, and will pass such objects into that backend's other functions.\n"},"docs/concretization_strategies.html":{"url":"docs/concretization_strategies.html","title":"Symbolic Memory Addressing","keywords":"","body":"Symbolic memory addressing\nangr supports symbolic memory addressing, meaning that offsets into memory may be symbolic.\nOur implementation of this is inspired by \"Mayhem\".\nSpecifically, this means that angr concretizes symbolic addresses when they are used as the target of a write.\nThis causes some surprises, as users tend to expect symbolic writes to be treated purely symbolically, or \"as symbolically\" as we treat symbolic reads, but that is not the default behavior.\nHowever, like most things in angr, this is configurable.\nThe address resolution behavior is governed by concretization strategies, which are subclasses of angr.concretization_strategies.SimConcretizationStrategy.\nConcretization strategies for reads are set in state.memory.read_strategies and for writes in state.memory.write_strategies.\nThese strategies are called, in order, until one of them is able to resolve addresses for the symbolic index.\nBy setting your own concretization strategies (or through the use of SimInspect address_concretization breakpoints, described above), you can change the way angr resolves symbolic addresses.\nFor example, angr's default concretization strategies for writes are:\n\nA conditional concretization strategy that allows symbolic writes (with a maximum range of 128 possible solutions) for any indices that are annotated with angr.plugins.symbolic_memory.MultiwriteAnnotation.\nA concretization strategy that simply selects the maximum possible solution of the symbolic index.\n\nTo enable symbolic writes for all indices, you can either add the SYMBOLIC_WRITE_ADDRESSES state option at state creation time or manually insert a angr.concretization_strategies.SimConcretizationStrategyRange object into state.memory.write_strategies.\nThe strategy object takes a single argument, which is the maximum range of possible solutions that it allows before giving up and moving on to the next (presumably non-symbolic) strategy.\nWriting concretization strategies\nTODO\n"},"docs/java_support.html":{"url":"docs/java_support.html","title":"Java Symbolic Execution","keywords":"","body":"angr also supports symbolically executing Java code and Android

For example, maybe your program is running on an embedded system and you have access to a debug interface, but you can't easily replicate the hardware in a simulated environment.\nThis is the perfect scenario for Symbion, our interleaved execution technique!\nWe implemented a built-in system that let users define a ConcreteTarget that is used to \"import\" a concrete state of the target program from an external source into angr. Once the state is imported you can make parts of the state symbolic, use symbolic execution on this state, run your analyses, and finally concretize the symbolic parts and resume concrete execution in the external environment. By iterating this process it is possible to implement run-time and interactive advanced symbolic analyses that are backed up by the real program's execution!\nIsn't that cool?\nHow to install\nTo use this technique you’ll need an implementation of a ConcreteTarget (effectively, an object that is going to be the \"glue\" between angr and the external process.) We ship a default one (the AvatarGDBConcreteTarget, which control an instance of a program being debugged under GDB) in the following repo https://github.com/angr/angr-targets.\nAssuming you installed angr-dev, activate the virtualenv and run:\ngit clone https://github.com/angr/angr-targets.git\ncd angr-targets\npip install .\n\nNow you’re ready to go!\nGists\nOnce you have created an entry state, instantiated a SimulationManager, and specified a list of stop_points using the Symbion interface we are going to resume the concrete process execution.\n# Instantiating the ConcreteTarget\navatar_gdb = AvatarGDBConcreteTarget(avatar2.archs.x86.X86_64,\n                                     GDB_SERVER_IP, GDB_SERVER_PORT)\n\n# Creating the Project\np = angr.Project(binary_x64, concrete_target=avatar_gdb,\n                             use_sim_procedures=True)\n\n# Getting an entry_state\nentry_state = p.factory.entry_state()\n\n# Forget about these options as for now, will explain later.\nentry_state.options.add(angr.options.SYMBION_SYNC_CLE)\nentry_state.options.add(angr.options.SYMBION_KEEP_STUBS_ON_SYNC)      \n\n# Use Symbion!                                \nsimgr.use_technique(angr.exploration_techniques.Symbion(find=[0x85b853])\n\nWhen one of your stop_points (effectively a breakpoint) is hit, we give control to angr. \nA new plugin called concrete is in charge of synchronizing the concrete state of the program inside a new SimState. \nRoughly, synchronization does the following:\n\nAll the registers' values (NOT marked with concrete=False in the respective arch file in archinfo) are copied inside the new SimState.\nThe underlying memory backend is hooked in a way that all the further memory accesses triggered during symbolic execution are redirected to the concrete process.\nIf the project is initialized with SimProcedure (use_sim_procedures=True) we are going to re-hook the external functions' addresses with a SimProcedure if we happen to have it, otherwise with aSimProcedure stub (you can control this decision by using the Options SYMBION_KEEP_STUBS_ON_SYNC). Conversely, the real code of the function is executed inside angr (Warning: do that at your own risk!)\n\nOnce this process is completed, you can play with your new SimState backed by the concrete process stopped at that particular stop_point.\nOptions\nThe way we synchronize the concrete process inside angr is customizable by 2 state options:\n\nSYMBION_SYNC_CLE: this option controls the synchronization of the memory mapping of the program inside angr. When the project is created, the memory mapping inside angr is different from the one inside the concrete process (this will change as soon as Symbion will be fully compatible with archr). If you want the process mapping to be fully synchronized with the one of the concrete process, set this option to the SimState before initializing the SimulationManager (Note that this is going to happen at the first synchronization of the concrete process inside angr, NOT before)\nentry_state.options.add(angr.options.SYMBION_SYNC_CLE)\nsimgr = project.factory.simgr(state)\n\n\nSYMBION_KEEP_STUBS_ON_SYNC: this option controls how we re-hook external functions with SimProcedures. If the project has been initialized to use SimProcedures (use_sim_procedures=True), we are going to re-hook external functions with SimProcedures (if we have that particular implementation) or with a generic stub. If you want to execute SimProcedures for functions for which we have an available implementation and a generic stub SimProcedure for the ones we have not, set this option to the SimState before initializing the SimulationManager.

Similarly, when you return a value from the run function, it is placed into the state (again, according to the calling convention), and the actual control-flow action of returning from a function is performed, which depending on the architecture may involve jumping to the link register or jumping to the result of a stack pop.\nIt should be clear at this point that the SimProcedure we just wrote is meant to totally replace whatever function it is hooked over top of.\nIn fact, the original use case for SimProcedures was replacing library functions.\nMore on that later.\nImplementation Context\nOn a Project class, the dict project._sim_procedures is a mapping from address to SimProcedure instances.\nWhen the execution pipeline reaches an address that is present in that dict, that is, an address that is hooked, it will execute project._sim_procedures[address].execute(state).\nThis will consult the calling convention to extract the arguments, make a copy of itself in order to preserve thread safety, and run the run() method.\nIt is important to produce a new instance of the SimProcedure for each time it is run, since the process of running a SimProcedure necessarily involves mutating state on the SimProcedure instance, so we need separate ones for each step, lest we run into race conditions in multithreaded environments.\nkwargs\nThis hierarchy implies that you might want to reuse a single SimProcedure in multiple hooks.\nWhat if you want to hook the same SimProcedure in several places, but tweaked slightly each time?\nangr's support for this is that any additional keyword arguments you pass to the constructor of your SimProcedure will end up getting passed as keyword args to your SimProcedure's run() method.\nPretty cool!\nData Types\nIf you were paying attention to the example earlier, you noticed that when we printed out the arguments to the run() function, they came out as a weird > class.\nThis is a SimActionObject.\nBasically, you don't need to worry about it too much, it's just a thin wrapper over a normal bitvector.\nIt does a bit of tracking of what exactly you do with it inside the SimProcedure---this is helpful for static analysis.\nYou may also have noticed that we directly returned the python int 0 from the procedure.\nThis will automatically be promoted to a word-sized bitvector!\nYou can return a native number, a bitvector, or a SimActionObject.\nWhen you want to write a procedure that deals with floating point numbers, you will need to specify the calling convention manually.\nIt's not too hard, just provide a cc to the hook: cc = project.factory.cc_from_arg_kinds((True, True), ret_fp=True) and project.hook(address, ProcedureClass(cc=mycc))\nThis method for passing in a calling convention works for all calling conventions, so if angr's autodetected one isn't right, you can fix that.\nControl Flow\nHow can you exit a SimProcedure?\nWe've already gone over the simplest way to do this, returning a value from run().\nThis is actually shorthand for calling self.ret(value).\nself.ret() is the function which knows how to perform the specific action of returning from a function.\nSimProcedures can use lots of different functions like this!\n\nret(expr): Return from a function\njump(addr): Jump to an address in the binary\nexit(code): Terminate the program\ncall(addr, args, continue_at): Call a function in the binary\ninline_call(procedure, *args): Call another SimProcedure in-line and return the results\n\nThat second-last one deserves some looking-at.\nWe'll get there after a quick detour...\nConditional Exits\nWhat if we want to add a conditional branch out of a SimProcedure?\nIn order to do that, you'll need to work directly with the SimSuccessors object for the current execution step.\nThe interface for this is self.successors.add_successor(state, addr, guard, jumpkind).\nAll of these parameters should have an obvious meaning if you've followed along so far.\nKeep in mind that the state you pass in will NOT be copied and WILL be mutated, so be sure to make a copy beforehand if there will be more work to do!\nSimProcedure Continuations\nHow can we call a function in the binary and have execution resume within our SimProcedure?\nThere is a whole bunch of infrastructure called the \"SimProcedure Continuation\" that will let you do this.\nWhen you use self.call(addr, args, continue_at), addr is expected to be the address you'd like to call, args is the tuple of arguments you'd like to call it with, and continue_at is the name of another method in your SimProcedure class that you'd like execution to continue at when it returns.\nThis method must have the same signature as the run() method.\nFurthermore, you can pass the keyword argument cc as the calling convention that ought to be used to communicate with the callee.\nWhen you do this, you finish your current step, and execution will start again at the next step at the function you've specified.\nWhen that function returns, it has to return to some concrete address!\nThat address is specified by the SimProcedure runtime: an address is allocated in angr's externs segment to be used as the return site for returning to the given method call.\nIt is then hooked with a copy of the procedure instance tweaked to run the specified continue_at function instead of run(), with the same args and kwargs as the first time.\nThere are two pieces of metadata you need to attach to your SimProcedure class in order to use the continuation subsystem correctly:\n\nSet the class variable IS_FUNCTION = True\nSet the class variable local_vars to a tuple of strings, where each string is the name of an instance variable on your SimProcedure whose value you would like to persist to when you return.\nLocal variables can be any type so long as you don't mutate their instances.\n\nYou may have guessed by now that there exists some sort of auxiliary storage in order to hold on to all this data.\nYou would be right!\nThe state plugin state.callstack has an entry called .procedure_data which is used by the SimProcedure runtime to store information local to the current call frame.\nangr tracks the stack pointer in order to make the current top of the state.callstack a meaningful local data store.\nIt's stuff that ought to be stored in memory in a stack frame, but the data can't be serialized and/or memory allocation is hard.\nAs an example, let's look at the SimProcedure that angr uses internally to run all the shared library initializers for a full_init_state for a linux program:\nclass LinuxLoader(angr.SimProcedure):\n    NO_RET = True\n    IS_FUNCTION = True\n    local_vars = ('initializers',)\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.initializers = self.project.loader.initializers\n        self.run_initializer()\n\n    def run_initializer(self):\n        if len(self.initializers) == 0:\n            self.project._simos.set_entry_register_values(self.state)\n            self.jump(self.project.entry)\n        else:\n            addr = self.initializers[0]\n            self.initializers = self.initializers[1:]\n            self.call(addr, (self.state.posix.argc, self.state.posix.argv, self.state.posix.environ), 'run_initializer')\n\nThis is a particularly clever usage of the SimProcedure continuations.\nFirst, notice that the current project is available for use on the procedure instance.\nThis is some powerful stuff you can get yourself into; for safety you generally only want to use the project as a read-only or append-only data structure.\nHere we're just getting the list of dynamic intializers from the loader.\nThen, for as long as the list isn't empty, we pop a single function pointer out of the list, being careful not to mutate the list, since the list object is shared across states, and then call it, returning to the run_initializer function again.\nWhen we run out of initializers, we set up the entry state and jump to the program entry point.\nVery cool!\nGlobal Variables\nAs a brief aside, you can store global variables in state.globals.\nThis is a dictionary that just gets shallow-copied from state to successor state.\nBecause it's only a shallow copy, its members are the same instances, so the same rules as local variables in SimProcedure continuations apply.\nYou need to be careful not to mutate any item that is used as a global variable unless you know exactly what you're doing.\nHelping out static analysis\nWe've already looked at the class variable IS_FUNCTION, which allows you to use the SimProcedure continuation.\nThere are a few more class variables you can set, though these ones have no direct benefit to you - they merely mark attributes of your function so that static analysis knows what it's doing.\n\nNO_RET: Set this to true if control flow will never return from this function\nADDS_EXITS: Set this to true if you do any control flow other than returning\nIS_SYSCALL: Self-explanatory\n\nFurthermore, if you set ADDS_EXITS, you may also want to define the method static_exits().\nThis function takes a single parameter, a list of IRSBs that would be executed in the run-up to your function, and asks you to return a list of all the exits that you know would be produced by your function in that case.\nThe return value is expected to be a list of tuples of (address (int), jumpkind (str)).\nThis is meant to be a quick, best-effort analysis, and you shouldn't try to do anything crazy or intensive to get your answer.\nUser Hooks\nThe process of writing and using a SimProcedure makes a lot of assumptions that you want to hook over a whole function.\nWhat if you don't?\nThere's an alternate interface for hooking, a user hook, that lets you streamline the process of hooking sections of code.\n>>> @project.hook(0x1234, length=5)\n... def set_rax(state):\n...     state.regs.rax = 1\n\nThis is a lot simpler!\nThe idea is to use a single function instead of an entire SimProcedure subclass.\nNo extraction of arguments is performed, no complex control flow happens.\nControl flow is controlled by the length argument.\nAfter the function finishes executing in this example, the next step will start at 5 bytes after the hooked address.\nIf the length argument is omitted or set to zero, execution will resume executing the binary code at exactly the hooked address, without re-triggering the hook.\nThe Ijk_NoHook jumpkind allows this to happen.\nIf you want more control over control flow coming out of a user hook, you can return a list of successor states.\nEach successor will be expected to have state.regs.ip, state.scratch.guard, and state.scratch.jumpkind set.\nThe IP is the target instruction pointer, the guard is a symbolic boolean representing a constraint to add to the state related to it being taken as opposed to the others, and the jumpkind is a VEX enum string, like Ijk_Boring, representing the nature of the branch.\nThe general rule is, if you want your SimProcedure to either be able to extract function arguments or cause a program return, write a full SimProcedure class.\nOtherwise, use a user hook.\nHooking Symbols\nAs you should recall from the section on loading a binary, dynamically linked programs have a list of symbols that they must import from the libraries they have listed as dependencies, and angr will make sure, rain or shine, that every import symbol gets resolved by some address, whether it's a real implementaion of the function or just a dummy address hooked with a do-nothing stub.\nAs a result, you can just use the Project.hook_symbol API to hook the address referred to by a symbol!\nThis means that you can replace library functions with your own code.\nFor instance, to replace rand() with a function that always returns a consistent sequence of values:\n>>> class NotVeryRand(SimProcedure):\n...     def run(self, return_values=None):\n...         rand_idx = self.state.globals.get('rand_idx', 0) % len(return_values)\n...         out = return_values[rand_idx]\n...         self.state.globals['rand_idx'] = rand_idx + 1\n...         return out\n\n>>> project.hook_symbol('rand', NotVeryRand(return_values=[413, 612, 1025, 1111]))\n\nNow, whenever the program tries to call rand(), it'll return the integers from the return_values array in a loop.\n"},"docs/state_plugins.html":{"url":"docs/state_plugins.html","title":"Writing State Plugins","keywords":"","body":"State Plugins\nIf you want to store some data on a state and have that information propagated from successor to successor, the easiest way to do this is with state.globals.\nHowever, this can become obnoxious with large amounts of interesting data, doesn't work at all for merging states, and isn't very object-oriented.\nThe solution to these problems is to write a State Plugin - an appendix to the state that holds data and implements an interface for dealing with the lifecycle of a state.\nMy First Plugin\nLet's get started!\nAll state plugins are implemented as subclasses of angr.SimStatePlugin.\nOnce you've read this document, you can use the API reference for this class to quickly review the semantics of all the interfaces you should implement.\nThe most important method you need to implement is copy: it should be annotated with the memo staticmethod and take a dict called the \"memo\"---these'll be important later---and returns a copy of the plugin.\nShort of that, you can do whatever you want.\nJust make sure to call the superclass initializer!\n>>> import angr\n>>> class MyFirstPlugin(angr.SimStatePlugin):\n...     def __init__(self, foo):\n...         super(MyFirstPlugin, self).__init__()\n...         self.foo = foo\n... \n...     @angr.SimStatePlugin.memo\n...     def copy(self, memo):\n...         return MyFirstPlugin(self.foo)\n\n>>> state = angr.SimState(arch='AMD64')\n>>> state.register_plugin('my_plugin', MyFirstPlugin('bar'))\n>>> assert state.my_plugin.foo == 'bar'\n\n>>> state2 = state.copy()\n>>> state.my_plugin.foo = 'baz'\n>>> state3 = state.copy()\n>>> assert state2.my_plugin.foo == 'bar'\n>>> assert state3.my_plugin.foo == 'baz'\n\nIt works! Note that plugins automatically become available as attributes on the state.\nstate.get_plugin(name) is also available as a more programmatic interface.\nWhere's the state?\nState plugins have access to the state, right? So why isn't it part of the initializer?\nIt turns out, there are a plethora of issues related to initialization order and dependency issues, so to simplify things as much as possible, the state is not part of the initializer but is rather set onto the state in a separate phase, by using the set_state method.\nYou can override this state if you need to do things like propagate the state to subcomponents or extract architectural information.\n>>> def set_state(self, state):\n...     super(SimStatePlugin, self).set_state(state)\n...     self.symbolic_word = claripy.BVS('my_variable', self.state.arch.bits)\n\nNote the self.state! That's what the super set_state sets up.\nHowever, there's no guarantee on what order the states will be set onto the plugins in, so if you need to interact with other plugins for initialization, you need to override the init_state method.\nOnce again, there's no guarantee on what order these will be called in, so the rule is to make sure you set yourself up good enough during set_state so that if someone else tries to interact with you, no type errors will happen.\nHere's an example of a good use of init_state, to map a memory region in the state.\nThe use of an instance variable (presumably copied as part of copy()) ensures this only happens the first time the plugin is added to a state.\n>>> def init_state(self):\n...     if self.region is None:\n...        self.region = self.state.memory.map_region(SOMEWHERE, 0x1000, 7)\n\nNote: weak references\nself.state is not the state itself, but rather a weak proxy to the state.\nYou can still use this object as a normal state, but attempts to store it persistently will not work.\nMerging\nThe other element besides copying in the state lifecycle is merging.\nAs input you get the plugins to merge and a list of \"merge conditions\" - symbolic booleans that are the \"guard conditions\" describing when the values from each state should actually apply.\nThe important properties of the merge conditions are:\n\nThey are mutually exclusive and span an entire domain - exactly one may be satisfied at once, and there will be additional constraints to ensure that at least one must be satisfied.\nlen(merge_conditions) == len(others) + 1, since self counts too.\nzip(merge_conditions, [self] + others) will correctly pair merge conditions with plugins.\n\nDuring the merge function, you should mutate self to become the merged version of itself and all the others, with respect to the merge conditions.\nThis involves using the if-then-else structure that claripy provides.\nHere is an example of constructing this merged structure by merging a bitvector instance variable called myvar, producing a binary tree of if-then-else expressions searching for the correct condition:\nfor other_plugin, condition in zip(others, merge_conditions[1:]): # chop off self's condition\n    self.myvar = claripy.If(condition, other_plugin.myvar, self.myvar)\n\nThis is such a common construction that we provide a utility to perform it automatically: claripy.ite_cases.\nThe following code snippet is identical to the previous one:\nself.myvar = claripy.ite_cases(zip(merge_conditions[1:], [o.myvar for o in others]), self.myvar)\n\nKeep in mind that like the rest of the top-level claripy functions, ite_cases and If are also available from state.solver, and these versions will perform SimActionObject unwrapping if applicable.\nCommon Ancestor\nThe full prototype of the merge interface is def merge(self, others, merge_conditions, common_ancestor=None).\nothers and merge_conditions have been discussed in depth already.\nThe common ancestor is the instance of the plugin from the most recent common ancestor of the states being merged.\nIt may not be available for all merges, in which case it will be None. There are no rules for how exactly you should use this to improve the quality of your merges, but you may find it useful in more complex setups.\nWidening\nThere is another kind of merging called widening which takes several states and produces a more general state. It is used during static analysis.\nTODO: @FISH PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THIS MEANS\nSerialization\nIn order to support serialization of states which contain your plugin, you should implement the __getstate__/__setstate__ magic method pair.\nKeep in mind the following guidelines:\n\nYour serialization result should not include the state.\nAfter deserialization, set_state() will be called again.\n\nThis means that plugins are \"detached\" from the state and serialized in an isolated environment, and then reattached to the state on deserialization.\nPlugins all the way down\nYou may have components within your state plugins which are large and complicated and start breaking object-orientation in order to make copy/merge work well with the state lifecycle.\nYou're in luck! Things can be state plugins even if they aren't directly attached to a state.\nA great example of this is SimFile, which is a state plugin but is stored in the filesystem plugin, and is never used with SimState.register_plugin.\nWhen you're doing this, there are a handful of rules to remember which will keep your plugins safe and happy:\n\nAnnotate your copy function with @SimStatePlugin.memo.\nIn order to prevent divergence while copying multiple references to the same plugin, make sure you're passing the memo (the argument to copy) to the .copy of any subplugins. This with the previous point will preserve object identity.\nIn order to prevent duplicate merging while merging multiple references to the same plugin, there should be a concept of the \"owner\" of each instance, and only the owner should run the merge routine.\nWhile passing arguments down into sub-plugins merge() routines, make sure you unwrap others and common_ancestor into the appropriate types. For example, if PluginA contains a PluginB, the former should do the following:\n\n>>> def merge(self, others, merge_conditions, common_ancestor=None):\n...     # ... merge self\n...     self.plugin_b.merge([o.plugin_b for o in others], merge_conditions,\n...         common_ancestor=None if common_ancestor is None else common_ancestor.plugin_b)\n\nSetting Defaults\nTo make it so that a plugin will automatically become available on a state when requested, without having to register it with the state first, you can register it as a default.\nThe following code example will make it so that whenever you access state.my_plugin, a new instance of MyPlugin will be instanciated and registered with the state.\nMyPlugin.register_default('my_plugin')\n\n"},"docs/environment.html":{"url":"docs/environment.html","title":"Extending the Environment Model","keywords":"","body":"Extending the Environment Model\nOne of the biggest issues you may encounter while using angr to analyze programs is an incomplete model of the environment, or the APIs, surrounding your program.\nThis usually takes the form of syscalls or dynamic library calls, or in rare cases, loader artifacts.\nangr provides a convenient interface to do most of these things!\nEverything discussed here involves writing SimProcedures, so make sure you know how to do that!.\nNote that this page should be treated as a narrative document, not a reference document, so you should read it at least once start to end.\nSetup\nYou probably want to have a development install of angr, i.e. set up with the script in the angr-dev repository.\nIt is remarkably easy to add new API models by just implementing them in certain folders of the angr repository.\nThis is also desirable because any work you do in this field will almost always be useful to other people, and this makes it extremely easy to submit a pull request.\nHowever, if you want to do your development out-of-tree, you want to work against a production version of angr, or you want to make customized versions of already-implemented API functions, there are ways to incorporate your extensions programmatically.\nBoth these techniques, in-tree and out-of-tree, will be documented at each step.\nDynamic library functions - import dependencies\nThis is the easiest case, and the case that SimProcedures were originally designed for.\nFirst, you need to write a SimProcedure representing the function.\nThen you need to let angr know about it.\nCase 1, in-tree development: SimLibraries and catalogues\nangr has a magical folder in its repository, angr/procedures.\nWithin it are all the SimProcedure implementations that come bundled with angr as well as information about what libraries implement what functions.\nEach folder in the procedures directory corresponds to some sort of standard, or a body that specifies the interface part of an API and its semantics.\nWe call each folder a catalog of procedures.\nFor example, we have libc which contains the functions defined by the C standard library, and a separate folder posix which contains the functions defined by the posix standard.\nThere is some magic which automatically scrapes these folders in the procedures directory and organizes them into the angr.SIM_PROCEDURES dict.\nFor example, angr/procedures/libc/printf.py contains both class printf and class __printf_chk, so there exists both angr.SIM_PROCEDURES['libc']['printf'] and angr.SIM_PROCEDURES['libc']['__printf_chk'].\nThe purpose of this categorization is to enable easy sharing of procedures among different libraries.\nFor example. libc.so.6 contains all the C standard library functions, but so does msvcrt.dll!\nThese relationships are represented with objects called SimLibraries which represent an actual shared library file, its functions, and their metadata.\nTake a look at the API reference for SimLibrary along with the code for setting up glibc to learn how to use it.\nSimLibraries are defined in a special folder in the procedures directory, procedures/definitions.\nFiles in here should contain an instance, not a subclass, of SimLibrary.\nThe same magic that scrapes up SimProcedures will also scrape up SimLibraries and put them in angr.SIM_LIBRARIES, keyed on each of their common names.\nFor example, angr/procedures/definitions/linux_loader.py contains lib = SimLibrary(); lib.set_library_names('ld.so', 'ld-linux.so', 'ld.so.2', 'ld-linux.so.2', 'ld-linux-x86_64.so.2'), so you can access it via angr.SIM_LIBRARIES['ld.so'] or angr.SIM_LIBRARIES['ld-linux.so'] or any of the other names.\nAt load time, all the dynamic library dependencies are looked up in SIM_LIBRARIES and their procedures (or stubs!) are hooked into the project's address space to summarize any functions it can.\nThe code for this process is found here.\nSO, the bottom line is that you can just write your own SimProcedure and SimLibrary definitions, drop them into the directory structure, and they'll automatically be applied.\nIf you're adding a procedure to an existing library, you can just drop it into the appropriate catalog and it'll be picked up by all the libraries using that catalog, since most libraries construct their list of function implementation by batch-adding entire catalogs.\nCase 2, out-of-tree development, tight integration\nIf you'd like to implement your procedures outside the angr repository, you can do that.\nYou effectively do this by just manually adding your procedures to the appropriate SimLibrary.\nJust call angr.SIM_LIBRARIES[libname].add(name, proc_cls) to do the registration.\nNote that this will only work if you do this before the project is loaded with angr.Project.\nNote also that adding the procedure to angr.SIM_PROCEDURES, i.e. adding it directly to a catalog, will not work, since these catalogs are used to construct the SimLibraries only at import and are used by value, not by reference.\nCase 3, out-of-tree development, loose integration\nFinally, if you don't want to mess with SimLibraries at all, you can do things purely on the project level with hook_symbol.\nSyscalls\nUnlike dynamic library methods, syscall procedures aren't incorporated into the project via hooks.\nInstead, whenever a syscall instruction is encountered, the basic block should end with a jumpkind of Ijk_Sys.\nThis will cause the next step to be handled by the SimOS associated with the project, which will extract the syscall number from the state and query a specialized SimLibrary with that.\nThis deserves some explanation.\nThere is a subclass of SimLibrary called SimSyscallLibrary which is used for collecting all the functions that are part of an operating system's syscall interface.\nSimSyscallLibrary uses the same system for managing implementations and metadata as SimLibrary, but adds on top of it a system for managing syscall numbers for multiple ABIs (application binary interfaces, like an API but lower level).\nThe best example for an implementation of a SimSyscallLibrary is the linux syscalls.\nIt keeps its procedures in a normal SimProcedure catalog called linux_kernel and adds them to the library, then adds several syscall number mappings, including separate mappings for mips-o32, mips-n32, and mips-n64.\nIn order for syscalls to be supported in the first place, the project's SimOS must inherit from SimUserland, itself a SimOS subclass.\nThis requires the class to call SimUserland's constructor with a super() call that includes the syscall_library keyword argument, specifying the specific SimSyscallLibrary that contains the appropriate procedures and mappings for the operating system.\nAdditionally, the class's configure_project must perform a super() call including the abi_list keyword argument, which contains the list of ABIs that are valid for the current architecture.\nIf the ABI for the syscall can't be determined by just the syscall number, for example, that amd64 linux programs can use either int 0x80 or syscall to invoke a syscall and these two ABIs use overlapping numbers, the SimOS cal override syscall_abi(), which takes a SimState and returns the name of the current syscall ABI.\nThis is determined for int80/syscall by examining the most recent jumpkind, since libVEX will produce different syscall jumpkinds for the different instructions.\nCalling conventions for syscalls are a little weird right now and they ought to be refactored.\nThe current situation requires that angr.SYSCALL_CC be a map of maps {arch_name: {os_name: cc_cls}}, where os_name is the value of project.simos.name, and each of the calling convention classes must include an extra method called syscall_number which takes a state and return the current syscall number.\nLook at the bottom of calling_conventions.py to learn more about it.\nNot very object-oriented at all...\nAs a side note, each syscall is given a unique address in a special object in CLE called the \"kernel object\".\nUpon a syscall, the address for the specific syscall is set into the state's instruction pointer, so it will show up in the logs.\nThese addresses are not hooked, they are just used to identify syscalls during analysis given only an address trace.\nThe test for determining if an address corresponds to a syscall is project.simos.is_syscall_addr(addr) and the syscall corresponding to the address can be retrieved with project.simos.syscall_from_addr(addr).\nCase 1, in-tree development\nSimSyscallLibraries are stored in the same place as the normal SimLibraries, angr/procedures/definitions.\nThese libraries don't have to specify any common name, but they can if they'd like to show up in SIM_LIBRARIES for easy access.\nThe same thing about adding procedures to existing catalogs of dynamic library functions also applies to syscalls - implementing a linux syscall is as easy as writing the SimProcedure and dropping the implemementation into angr/procedures/linux_kernel.\nAs long as the class name matches one of the names in the number-to-name mapping of the SimLibrary (all the linux syscall numbers are included with recent releases of angr), it will be used.\nTo add a new operating system entirely, you need to implement the SimOS as well, as a subclass of SimUserland.\nTo integrate it into the tree, you should add it to the simos directory, but this is not a magic directory like procedures. Instead, you should add a line to angr/simos/__init__.py calling register_simos() with the OS name as it appears in project.loader.main_object.os and the SimOS class.\nYour class should do everything described above.\nCase 2, out-of-tree development, tight integration\nYou can add syscalls to a SimSyscallLibrary the same way you can add functions to a normal SimLibrary, by tweaking the entries in angr.SIM_LIBRARIES.\nIf you're this for linux you want angr.SIM_LIBRARIES['linux'].add(name, proc_cls).\nYou can register a SimOS with angr from out-of-tree as well - the same register_simos method is just sitting there waiting for you as angr.simos.register_simos(name, simos_cls).\nCase 3, out-of-tree development, loose integration\nThe SimSyscallLibrary the SimOS uses is copied from the original during setup, so it is safe to mutate.\nYou can directly fiddle with project.simos.syscall_library to manipulate an individual project's syscalls.\nYou can provide a SimOS class (not an instance) directly to the Project constructor via the simos keyword argument, so you can specify the SimOS for a project explicitly if you like.\nSimData\nWhat about when there is an import dependency on a data object?\nThis is easily resolved when the given library is actually loaded into memory - the relocation can just be resolved as normal.\nHowever, when the library is not loaded (for example, auto_load_libs=False, or perhaps some dependency is simply missing), things get tricky.\nIt is not possible to guess in most cases what the value should be, or even what its size should be, so if the guest program ever dereferences a pointer to such a symbol, emulation will go off the rails.\nCLE will warn you when this might happen:\n[22:26:58] [cle.backends.externs] |  WARNING: Symbol was allocated without a known size; emulation will fail if it is used non-opaquely: _rtld_global\n[22:26:58] [cle.backends.externs] |  WARNING: Symbol was allocated without a known size; emulation will fail if it is used non-opaquely: __libc_enable_secure\n[22:26:58] [cle.backends.externs] |  WARNING: Symbol was allocated without a known size; emulation will fail if it is used non-opaquely: _rtld_global_ro\n[22:26:58] [cle.backends.externs] |  WARNING: Symbol was allocated without a known size; emulation will fail if it is used non-opaquely: _dl_argv\nIf you see this message and suspect it is causing issues (i.e. the program is actually introspecting the value of these symbols), you can resolve it by implementing and registering a SimData class, which is like a SimProcedure but for data.\nSimulated data. Very cool.\nA SimData can effectively specify some data that must be used to provide an unresolved import symbol.\nIt has a number of mechanisms to make this more useful, including the ability to specify relocations and subdependencies.\nLook at the SimData class reference and the existing SimData subclasses for guidelines on how to do this.\n"},"docs/analysis_writing.html":{"url":"docs/analysis_writing.html","title":"Writing Analyses","keywords":"","body":"Writing Analyses\nAn analysis can be created by subclassing the angr.Analysis class.\nIn this section, we'll create a mock analysis to show off the various features.\nLet's start with something simple:\n>>> import angr\n\n>>> class MockAnalysis(angr.Analysis):\n...     def __init__(self, option):\n...         self.option = option\n\n>>> angr.AnalysesHub.register_default('MockAnalysis', MockAnalysis) # register the class with angr's global analysis list\n\nThis is a very simple analysis -- it takes an option, and stores it.\nOf course, it's not useful, but this is just a demonstration.\nLet's see how to run our new analysis:\n>>> proj = angr.Project(\"/bin/true\")\n>>> mock = proj.analyses.MockAnalysis('this is my option')\n>>> assert mock.option == 'this is my option'\n\nWorking with projects\nVia some python magic, your analysis will automatically have the project upon which you are running it under the self.project property.\nUse this to interact with your project and analyze it!\n>>> class ProjectSummary(angr.Analysis):\n...     def __init__(self):\n...         self.result = 'This project is a %s binary with an entry point at %#x.' % (self.project.arch.name, self.project.entry)\n\n>>> angr.AnalysesHub.register_default('ProjectSummary', ProjectSummary)\n>>> proj = angr.Project(\"/bin/true\")\n\n>>> summary = proj.analyses.ProjectSummary()\n>>> print(summary.result)\nThis project is a AMD64 binary with an entry point at 0x401410.\n\nAnalysis Resilience\nSometimes, your (or our) code might suck and analyses might throw exceptions.\nWe understand, and we also understand that oftentimes a partial result is better than nothing.\nThis is specifically true when, for example, running an analysis on all of the functions in a program.\nEven if some of the functions fails, we still want to know the results of the functions that do not.\nTo facilitate this, the Analysis base class provides a resilience context manager under self._resilience.\nHere's an example:\n>>> class ComplexFunctionAnalysis(angr.Analysis):\n...     def __init__(self):\n...         self._cfg = self.project.analyses.CFG()\n...         self.results = { }\n...         for addr, func in self._cfg.function_manager.functions.items():\n...             with self._resilience():\n...                 if addr % 2 == 0:\n...                     raise ValueError(\"can't handle functions at even addresses\")\n...                 else:\n...                     self.results[addr] = \"GOOD\"\n\nThe context manager catches any exceptions thrown and logs them (as a tuple of the exception type, message, and traceback) to self.errors.\nThese are also saved and loaded when the analysis is saved and loaded (although the traceback is discarded, as it is not picklable).\nYou can tune the effects of the resilience with two optional keyword parameters to self._resilience().\nThe first is name, which affects where the error is logged.\nBy default, errors are placed in self.errors, but if name is provided, then instead the error is logged to self.named_errors, which is a dict mapping name to a list of all the errors that were caught under that name.\nThis allows you to easily tell where thrown without examining its traceback.\nThe second argument is exception, which should be the type of the exception that _resilience should catch.\nThis defaults to Exception, which handles (and logs) almost anything that could go wrong.\nYou can also pass a tuple of exception types to this option, in which case all of them will be caught.\nUsing _resilience has a few advantages:\n\nYour exceptions are gracefully logged and easily accessible afterwards. This is really nice for writing testcases.\nWhen creating your analysis, the user can pass fail_fast=True, which transparently disable the resilience, which is really nice for manual testing.\nIt's prettier than having try/except everywhere.\n\nHave fun with analyses!

you must call am_event in order to trigger the callbacks.\nOne useful feature of this model is that you can provide arbitrary keyword arguments to am_event, and they will be passed on to each callback.\nThis means that you should always have your callbacks take **kwargs in order to account for unknown parameters.\nThis feature is particularly useful to prevent feedback loops - if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to broadcast an event from your callback, you can add an argument which you can use as a flag not to recurse any further.\nNext, object reference mutability.\nLet's say you have a widget that displays information about the project.\nFollowing the principle of least access, you should only provide as much information as is necessary to do the job - in this case, just the project object.\nIf you provide the basic project object, this will cause issues when a new project is loaded.\nNotably, there will be a dangling reference held to the original project, preventing it from being garbage collected, and the widget will not update, continuing to show the old project's information.\nNow, if you provide the project's ObjectContainer, a new project can be created and inserted into the container and the reference will instantly be available to your widget.\nIf you ever wanted to load a new project yourself, all you have to do is assign to instance.project.am_obj and then send off an event.\nCombined with the event publication model, this provides an efficient way to build responsive UIs that follow the principle of least access.\nOne important way that you can't use the object container the same way that you would a normal object is that is None will obviously not work.\nTo resolve this, you can use instance.project.am_none - this will be True when no project is loaded.\nOne interesting feature of the ObjectContainer is that they can nest.\nIf you have a container which contains a container which contains an object, any events sent to the inner container will also be sent to subscribers to the outer container.\nThis allows patterns such as the list of SimStates actually containing a list of ObjectContainers which contain states, and the \"current state\" container actually contains one of these containers.\nThe result of this is that UI elements can either subscribe to the current state, no matter \nA full list of standard ObjectContainers that can be found in the instance __init__ method.\nThere are more containers floating around for synchronizing on non-global elements - for example, the current state of the disassembly view is synchronized through its InfoDock object.\nGiven a disassembly view instance, you can subscribe to, for example, its current selected instrucitons through view.infodock.selected_insns.\nManipulating UI elements\nThe workspace contains methods to manipulate UI elements.\nNotably, you can manipulate all open tabs with the workspace.view_manager reference.\nAdditionally, you can pass any sort of object you like to workspace.viz() and it will attempt to visualize the object in the current window.\nWriting plugins\nangr management has a very flexible plugin framework.\nA plugin is a python file containing a subclass of angrmanagement.plugins.BasePlugin.\nPlugin files will be automatically loaded from the plugins module of angr management, and also from ~/.local/share/angr-management/plugins.\nThese paths are configurable through the program configuration, but at time of writing this is not exposed in the UI.\nThe best way to see the tools you can use while building a plugin is to read the plugin base class source code.\nAny method or attribute can be overridden from a base class and will be automatically called on relevant events.\nWriting tests\nLook at the existing tests for examples.\nGenerally, you can test UI components by creating the component and driving input to it via QTest.\nYou can create a headless MainWindow instance by passing show=False to its constructor - this will also get you access to a workspace and an instance.\n"},"docs/examples.html":{"url":"docs/examples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"angr examples\nTo help you get started with angr, we've created several examples.\nWe've tried to organize them into major categories, and briefly summarize that each example will expose you to.\nEnjoy!\nThere are also a great amount of slightly more redundant examples (these mostly stem from CTF problems solved with angr by Shellphish) here.\nIf you want a high-level cheatsheet of the \"techniques\" used in the examples, see the angr strategies cheatsheet by Florent Bordignon.\nTo jump to a specific category:\n\nIntroduction - examples showing off the very basics of angr's functionality\nReversing - examples showing angr being used in reverse engineering tasks\nVulnerability Discovery - examples of angr being used to search for vulnerabilities\nExploitation - examples of angr being used as an exploitation assistance tool\n\nIntroduction\nThese are some introductory examples to give an idea of how to use angr's API.\nFauxware\nThis is a basic script that explains how to use angr to symbolically execute a program and produce concrete input satisfying certain conditions.\nBinary, source, and script are found here.\nReversing\nThese are examples that use angr to solve reverse engineering challenges.\nThere are a lot of these.\nWe've chosen the most unique ones, and relegated the rest to the CTF Challenges section below.\nBeginner reversing example: little_engine\nScript author: Michael Reeves (github: @mastermjr)\nScript runtime: 3 min 26 seconds (206 seconds)\nConcepts presented: \nstdin constraining, concrete optimization with Unicorn\nThis challenge is similar to the csaw challenge below, however the reversing is much more simple. The original code, solution, and writeup for the challenge can be found at the b01lers github here.\nThe angr solution script is here and the binary is here.\nWhitehat CTF 2015 - Crypto 400\nScript author: Yan Shoshitaishvili (github: @Zardus)\nScript runtime: 30 seconds\nConcepts presented: statically linked binary (manually hooking with function summaries), commandline argument, partial solutions\nWe solved this crackme with angr's help.\nThe resulting script will help you understand how angr can be used for crackme assistance, not a full-out solve.\nSince angr cannot solve the actual crypto part of the challenge, we use it just to reduce the keyspace, and brute-force the rest.\nYou can find this script here and the binary here.\nCSAW CTF 2015 Quals - Reversing 500, \"wyvern\"\nScript author: Audrey Dutcher (github: @rhelmot)\nScript runtime: 15 mins\nConcepts presented: stdin constraining, concrete optimization with Unicorn\nangr can outright solve this challenge with very little assistance from the user.\nThe script to do so is here and the binary is here.\nTUMCTF 2016 - zwiebel\nScript author: Fish\nScript runtime: 2 hours 31 minutes with pypy and Unicorn - expect much longer with CPython only\nConcepts presented: self-modifying code support, concrete optimization with Unicorn\nThis example is of a self-unpacking reversing challenge.\nThis example shows how to enable Unicorn support and self-modification support in angr.\nUnicorn support is essential to solve this challenge within a reasonable amount of time - simulating the unpacking code symbolically is very slow.\nThus, we execute it concretely in unicorn/qemu and only switch into symbolic execution when needed.\nYou may refer to other writeup about the internals of this binary.\nI didn’t reverse too much since I was pretty confident that angr is able to solve it :-)\nThe long-term goal of optimizing angr is to execute this script within 10 minutes.\nPretty ambitious :P\nHere is the binary and the script.\nFlareOn 2015 - Challenge 5\nScript author: Adrian Tang (github: @tangabc)\nScript runtime: 2 mins 10 secs\nConcepts presented: Windows support\nThis is another reversing challenge from the FlareOn challenges.\n\"The challenge is designed to teach you about PCAP file parsing and traffic decryption by\nreverse engineering an executable used to generate it. This is a typical scenario in our\nmalware analysis practice where we need to figure out precisely what the malware was doing\non the network\"\nFor this challenge, the author used angr to represent the desired encoded output as a series of constraints for the SAT solver to solve for the input.\nFor a detailed write-up please visit the author's post here and\nyou can also find the solution from the FireEye here\n0ctf quals 2016 - trace\nScript author: WGH (wgh@bushwhackers.ru)\nScript runtime: 1 min 50 secs (CPython 2.7.10), 1 min 12 secs (PyPy 4.0.1)\nConcepts presented: guided symbolic tracing\nIn this challenge we're given a text file with trace of a program execution. The file has\ntwo columns, address and instruction executed. So we know all the instructions being executed,\nand which branches were taken. But the initial data is not known.\nReversing reveals that a buffer on the stack is initialized with known constant string first,\nthen an unknown string is appended to it (the flag), and finally it's sorted with some\nvariant of quicksort. And we need to find the flag somehow.\nangr easily solves this problem. We only have to direct it to the right direction\nat every branch, and the solver finds the flag at a glance.\nFiles are here.\nASIS CTF Finals 2015 - license\nScript author: Fish Wang (github: @ltfish)\nScript runtime: 3.6 sec\nConcepts presented: using the filesystem, manual symbolic summary execution\nThis is a crackme challenge that reads a license file.\nRather than hooking the read operations of the flag file, we actually pass in a filesystem with the correct file created.\nHere is the binary and the script.\nDEFCON Quals 2017 - Crackme2000\nScript author: Shellphish\nScript runtime: varies, but on the order of seconds\nConcepts presented: automated reverse engineering\nDEFCON Quals had a whole category for automatic reversing in 2017.\nOur scripts are here.\nVulnerability Discovery\nThese are examples of angr being used to identify vulnerabilities in binaries.\nBeginner vulnerability discovery example: strcpy_find\nScript author: Kyle Ossinger (github: @k0ss)\nConcepts presented: exploration to vulnerability, programmatic find condition\nThis is the first in a series of \"tutorial scripts\" I'll be making which use angr to find exploitable conditions in binaries.\nThe first example is a very simple program.\nThe script finds a path from the main entry point to strcpy, but only when we control the source buffer of the strcpy operation.\nTo hit the right path, angr has to solve for a password argument, but angr solved this in less than 2 seconds on my machine using the standard python interpreter.\nThe script might look large, but that's only because I've heavily commented it to be more helpful to beginners.\nThe challenge binary is here and the script is here.\nCGC crash identification\nScript author: Antonio Bianchi, Jacopo Corbetta\nConcepts presented: exploration to vulnerability\nThis is a very easy binary containing a stack buffer overflow and an easter egg.\nCADET_00001 is one of the challenge released by DARPA for the Cyber Grand Challenge:\nlink\nThe binary can run in the DECREE VM: link\nA copy of the original challenge and the angr solution is provided here\nCADET_00001.adapted (by Jacopo Corbetta) is the same program, modified to be runnable in an Intel x86 Linux machine.\nGrub \"back to 28\" bug\nScript author: Audrey Dutcher (github: @rhelmot)\nConcepts presented: unusal target (custom function hooking required), use of exploration techniques to categorize and prune the program's state space\nThis is the demonstration presented at 32c3. The script uses angr to discover the input to crash grub's password entry prompt.\nscript - vulnerable module\nExploitation\nThese are examples of angr's use as an exploitation assistance engine.\nInsomnihack Simple AEG\nScript author: Nick Stephens (github: @NickStephens)\nConcepts presented: automatic exploit generation, global symbolic data tracking\nDemonstration for Insomni'hack 2016.  The script is a very simple implementation of AEG.\nscript\nSecuInside 2016 Quals - mbrainfuzz - symbolic exploration for exploitability conditions\nScript author: nsr (nsr@tasteless.eu)\nScript runtime: ~15 seconds per binary\nConcepts presented: symbolic exploration guided by static analysis, using the CFG\nOriginally, a binary was given to the ctf-player by the challenge-service, and an exploit had to be crafted automatically.\nFour sample binaries, obtained during the ctf, are included in the example.\nAll binaries follow the same format; the command-line argument is validated in a bunch of functions, and when every check succeeds, a memcpy() resulting into a stack-based buffer overflow is executed.\nangr is used to find the way through the binary to the memcpy() and to generate valid inputs to every checking function individually.\nThe sample binaries and the script are located here and additional information be found at the author's Write-Up.\nSECCON 2016 Quals - ropsynth\nScript author: Yan Shoshitaishvili (github @zardus) and Nilo Redini\nScript runtime: 2 minutes\nConcepts presented: automatic ROP chain generation, binary modification, reasoning over constraints, reasoning over action history\nThis challenge required the automatic generation of ropchains, with the twist that every ropchain was succeeded by an input check that, if not passed, would terminate the application.\nWe used symbolic execution to recover those checks, removed the checks from the binary, used angrop to build the ropchains, and instrumented them with the inputs to pass the checks.\nThe various challenge files are located here, with the actual solve script here.\n"},"docs/appendices/ops.html":{"url":"docs/appendices/ops.html","title":"List of Claripy Operations","keywords":"","body":"List of Claripy Operations\nArithmetic and Logic\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\nExample\n\n\n\n\nLShR\nLogically shifts an expression to the right.

Thanks @bannsec.\n(#1408) ANA, angr's old identity-aware serialization backend, has been removed. Instead of non-obvious serialization behavior, all angr objects should now be pickleable. If one is not, please file an issue. For use-cases that require identity-awareness (i.e., deduplicating ASTs across states serialized at different times), an angr.vaults module has been introduced.\nAdded a facility to synchronize state between angr and a running target a la avatar2\nChanged unconstrained registers/memory warning to be less obnoxious and contain useful information. Also added SYMBOL_FILL_UNCONSTRAINED_REGISTERS and SYMBOL_FILL_UNCONSTRAINED_MEMORY state options to silence them.\n\nangr 8.18.10.25\n\nThe IDA backend for CLE has been removed. It has been broken for quite some time, but now it has been disabled for your own safety.\nSurveyors have been removed! Finally! This is thanks to @danse-macabre who contributed an Exploration Technique for the Slicecutor. Backwards slicing has now been brought out of the angr dark ages.\nSimCC can now be initialized with a string containing C function prototype in its func_ty argument\nSimilarly, Callable can now be run with its arguments instanciated from a string containing C expressions\nTracer has been substantially refactored - it will now handle more kinds of desyncs, ASLR slides, and is much more friendly for hacking. We will be continuing to improve it!\nThe Oppologist and Driller have been refactored to play nice with other exploration techniques\nSimProcedure continuations now have symbols in the externs object, so describe_addr will work on them. Additionally, the representation for SimProcedure (appearing in history.descriptions and project._sim_procedures among other places) has been improved to show this information.\n\nangr 8.18.10.5\nLargely a bugfix release, but with a few bonus treats:\n\nAPI documentation has been rewritten for Exploration Technique. It should be much easier to use now.\nSimulation Manager will throw an error if you pass incorrect keyword arguments (??? why was it like this)\nThe save_unconstrained flag of Simulation Manager is now on by default\nIf a step produces only unsatisfiable states, they will appear in the 'unsat' stash regardless of the save_unsat setting, since this usually indicates a bug. Add unsat to the auto_drop parameter to restore the old behavior.\n\nangr 8.18.10.1\nWelcome to angr 8!\nThe biggest change for this major version bump is the transition to python 3.\nYou can read about this, as well as a few other breaking changes, in the migration guide.\n\nSwitch to python 3\nRefactor to Clemory to clean up the API and speed things up drastically\nRemove object.symbols_by_addr (dict) and add object.symbols (sorted list); add fuzzy parameter to loader.find_symbol\nCFGFast is much, much faster now. CFGAccurate has been renamed to CFGEmulated.\nSupport for avx2 unpack instructions, courtesy of D. J. Bernstein\nRemoved support for immutable simulation managers\nangr will now show you a warning when using uninitialized memory or registers\nangr will now NOT show you a warning if you have a capstone 3.x install unless you're actually interacting with the relevant missing parts\nMany, many, many bug fixes\n\nangr 7.8.7.1\n\nRemove LoopLimiter and DFG.\n(#1063) CFGAccurate can now leverage indirect jump resolvers to resolve indirect jumps.\n\nangr 7.8.6.23\n\n(PyVEX!#134) We now recognize LDMDB r11, {xxx, pc} as a ret instruction for ARM.\n(#1053) CFGFast spends less time running next_pos_with_sort_not_in(), thus it runs faster on large binaries.\n(#1080) Jump table resolvers now support resolving ARM jump tables.\n(#1081, together with the PyVEX commit 61efbdcf6303a936aa3de35011d2d1e3fe5fdea5) The memory footprint of CFGFast is noticeably smaller, especially on large binaries (over 10 MB in size).\n(#1034) Concretizing a SimFile with unconstrained size can no longer run you out of memory.\nOther minor changes and bug fixes.\n\nangr 7.8.6.16\n\nThe modeling of file system is refactored.\n(#808) Add a new class Control flow blanket (CFBlanket) to support generating a linear view of a control flow graph.\n(#863) Add support to AIL, the new angr intermediate language (still pretty WIP though). Merged in several static analyses (reaching definition analysis, VEX-to-AIL translation, redundant assignment elimination, code region identification, conrol flow structuring, etc.) that support the development of decompilation in the near future.\n(#888) SimulationManager is extensively refactored and cleaned up.\n(#892) Keystone is integrated. You can assemble instructions inside angr now.\n(#897) A new class PluginHub is added. Plugins (analyses, engines) are refactored to be based on PluginHub.\n(#899) Support of bidirectional mapping between syscall numbers and syscalls.\n(#925, #941, #942) A bunch of library function prototypes (including glibc) are added to angr.\n(#953) Fix the issue where evaluating the jump target of a jump table that contains many entries (e.g., > 512) is extremely slow.\n(#964) State options are now stored in insances of SimStateOptions. state.options is no longer a set of strings.\n(#973) Add two new exploration techniques: Stochastic and unique.\n(#996) SimType structs are now much easier to use.\n(#998) Add a new state option PRODUCE_ZERODIV_SUCCESSORS to generate divide-by-zero successors.\nSpeed improvements and bug fixes in CFG generation (CFGFast and CFGAccurate).\n\nangr 7.8.2.21\n\nRefactor of how syscall handling and SimSyscallLibrary work - it is now possible to handle syscalls using multiple ABIs in the same process\nAdded syscall name-number mappings from all linux ABIs, parsed from gdb\nAdd ManualMergepoint exploration technique for when veritesting is too mysterious for your tastes\nAdd LoopSeer exploration technique for managing loops during symbolic exploration (credit @tyb0807)\nAdd ProxyTechnique exploration technique for easily composing simple lambda-based instrumentations (credit @danse-macabre)\n\nangr 7.7.12.16\n\nYou can now tell where the variables implicitly created by angr come from! state.solver.BVS now can take a key parameter, which describes its meaning in relation to the emulated environment. You can then use state.solver.get_variables(...) and state.solver.describe_variables(...) to map tags and ASTs to and from each other. Check out the API docs!\nThe SimOS for a project is now a public property - project.simos instead of project._simos. Additionally, the SimOS code structure has been shuffled around a bit - it's now a subpackage instead of a submodule.\nThe core components of Tracer and Driller have been refactored into Exploration Techniques and integrated into angr proper, so you can now follow instrution traces without installing another repostory! (credit @tyb0807)\nArchinfo now contains a byte_width parameter and angr supports emulation of platforms with non-octet bytes, lord help us\nUpgraded to networkx 2 (credit @tyb0807)\nHopefully installation issues with capstone should be fixed FOREVER\nMinor fixes to gender\n\nangr 7.7.9.8\nWelcome to angr 7!\nWe worked long and hard all summer to make this release the best ever.\nIt introduces several breaking changes, so for a quick guide on the most common ways you'll need to update your scripts, take a look at the migration guide.\n\nSimuVEX has been removed and its components have been integrated into angr\nPath has been removed and its components have been integrated into SimState, notably the new history state plugin\nPathGroup has been renamed to SimulationManager\nSimState and SimProcedure now have a reference to their parent Project, though it is verboten to use it in anything other than an append-only fashion\nA new class SimLibrary is used to track SimProcedure and metadata corresponding to an individual shared library\nSeveral CLE interfaces have been refactored up for consistency\nHook has been removed. Hooking is now done with individual SimProcedure instances, which are shallow-copied at execution time for thread-safety.\nThe state.solver interface has been cleaned up drastically\n\nThese are the major refactor-y points.\nAs for the improvements:\n\nGreatly improved support for analyzing 32 bit windows binaries (partial credit @schieb)\nUnicorn will now stop for stop points and breakpoints in the middle of blocks (credit @bennofs)\nThe processor flags for a state can now be accessed through state.regs.eflags on x86 and state.regs.flags on ARM (partial credit @tyb0807)\nFledgling support for emulating exception handling. Currently the only implementation of this is support for Structured Exception Handling on Windows, see angr.SimOS.handle_exception for details\nFledgling support for runtime library loading by treating the CLE loader as an append-only interface, though only implemented for windows. See cle.Loader.dynamic_load and angr.procedures.win32.dynamic_loading for details.\nThe knowledge base has been refactored into a series of plugins similar to SimState (credit @danse-macabre)\nThe testcase-based function identifier we wrote for CGC has been integrated into angr as the Identifier analysis\nImproved support for writing custom VEX lifters\n\nangr 6.7.6.9\n\nangr: A static data-flow analysis framework has been introduced, and implemented as part of the ForwardAnalysis class. Additionally, a few exemplary data-flow analyses, like VariableRecovery and VariableRecoveryFast, have been implemented in angr.\nangr: We introduced the notion of variable to the angr world. Now a VariableManager is available in the knowledge base. Variable information can be recovered by running a variable recovery analysis. Currently the variable information recovered for each function is still pretty coarse. More updates to it will arrive soon.\nangr: Fix a bug in the topological sorting in CFGUtils, which resulted in suboptimal graph node ordering after sorting.\nSimuVEX: LAZY_SOLVES is no longer enabled by default during symbolic execution. It's still there if it's wanted, but it just caused confusion when on by default.\nSimuVEX: Thanks to @ekilmer, a few new libc SimProcedures are added.\nSimuVEX: The default memory model has been refactored for expandability. Custom pages can now be created (derive the simuvex.storage.ListPage class) and used instead of the default page classes to implement custom memory behavior for specific pages. The user-friendly API for this is pending the next release.\nangr-management: Implemented our own graph layout and edge routing algorithm. We do not rely on grandalf anymore.\nangr-management: Added support for displaying variable information for operands.\nangr-management: Added support for highlighting dependent operands when an operand is highlighted.\n\nangr 6.7.3.26\nBuilding off of the engine changes from the last release, we have begun to extend angr to other architectures. AVR and MSP430 are in progress. In the meantime, subwire has created a reference implementation of BrainFuck support in angr, done two different ways! Check out angr-platforms for more info!\n\nWe have rebased our fork of VEX on the latest master branch from Valgrind (as of 2 months ago, at least...). We have also submitted our patches to VEX to upstream, so we should be able to stop maintaining a fork pretty soon.\nThe way we interact with VEX has changed substancially, and should speed things up a bit.\nLoading sets of binaries with many import symbols has been sped up\nMany, many improvements to angr-management, including the switch away from enaml to using pyside directly.\n\nangr 6.7.1.13\nFor the last month, we have been working on a major refactor of the angr to change the way that angr reasons about the code that it analyzes.\nUntil now, angr has been bound to the VEX intermediate representation to lift native code, supporting a wide range of architectures but not being very expandable past them.\nThis release represents the ground work for what we call translation and execution engines.\nThese engines are independent backends, pluggable into the angr framework, that will allow angr to reason about a wide range of targets.\nFor now, we have restructured the existing VEX and Unicorn Engine support into this engine paradigm, but as we discuss in our blog post, the plan is to create engines to enable angr's reasoning of Java bytecode and source code, and to augment angr's environment support through the use of external dynamic sandboxes.\nFor now, these changes are mostly internal.\nWe have attempted to maintain compatibility for end-users, but those building systems atop angr will have to adapt to the modern codebase.\nThe following are the major changes:\n\nsimuvex: we have introduced SimEngine. SimEngine is a base class for abstractions over native code. For example, angr's VEX-specific functionality is now concentrated in SimEngineVEX, and new engines (such as SimEngineLLVM) can be implemented (even outside of simuvex itself) to support the analysis of new types of code.\nsimuvex: as part of the engines refactor, the SimRun class has been eliminated. Instead of different subclasses of SimRun that would be instantiated from an input state, engines each have a process function that, from an input state, produces a SimSuccessors instance containing lists of different successor states (normal, unsat, unconstrained, etc) and any engine-specific artifacts (such as the VEX statements. Take a look at successors.artifacts).\nsimuvex: state.mem[x:] = y now requires a type for storage (for example state.mem[x:].dword = y).\nsimuvex: the way of calling inline SimProcedures has been changed. Now you have to create a SimProcedure, and then call execute() on it and pass in a program state as well as the arguments.\nsimuvex: accessing registers through SimRegNameView (like state.regs.eax) always triggers SimInspect breakpoints and creates new actions. Now you can access a register by prefixing its name with an underscore (e.g. state.regs._eax or state._ip) to avoid triggering breakpoints or creating actions.\nangr: the way hooks work has slightly changed, though is backwards-compatible. The new angr.Hook class acts as a wrapper for hooks (SimProcedures and functions), keeping things cleaner in the project._sim_procedures dict.\nangr: we have deprecated the keyword argument max_size and changed it to to size in the angr.Block constructor (i.e., the argument to project.factory.block and more upstream methods (path.step, path_group.step, etc).\nangr: we have deprecated project.factory.sim_run and changed it to to project.factory.successors, and it now generates a SimSuccessors object.\nangr: project.factory.sim_block has been deprecated and replaced with project.factory.successors(default_engine=True).\nangr: angr syscalls are no longer hooks. Instead, the syscall table is now in project._simos.syscall_table. This will be made \"public\" after a usability refactor. If you were using project.is_hooked(addr) to see if an address has a related SimProcedure, now you probably want to check if there is a related syscall as well (using project._simos.syscall_table.get_by_addr(addr) is not None).\npyvex: to support custom lifters to VEX, pyvex has introduced the concept of backend lifters. Lifters can be written in pure python to produce VEX IR, allowing for extendability of angr's VEX-based analyses to other hardware architectures.\n\nAs usual, there are many other improvements and minor bugfixes.\n\nclaripy: support unsat_core() to get the core of unsatness of constraints. It is in fact a thin wrapper of the unsat_core() function provided by Z3. Also a new state option CONSTRAINT_TRACKING_IN_SOLVER is added to SimuVEX. That state option must be enabled if you want to use unsat_core() on any state.\nsimuvex: SimMemory.load() and SimMemory.store() now takes a new parameter disable_actions. Setting it to True will prevent any SimAction creation.\nangr: CFGFast has a better support for ARM binaries, especially for code in THUMB mode.\nangr: thanks to an improvement in SimuVEX, CFGAccurate now uses slightly less memory than before.\nangr: len() on path trace or addr_trace is made much faster.\nangr: Fix a crash during CFG generation or symbolic execution on platforms/architectures with no syscall defined.\nangr: as part of the refactor, BackwardSlicing is temporarily disabled. It will be re-enabled once all DDG-related refactor are merged to master.\n\nAdditionally, packaging and build-system improvements coordinated between the angr and Unicorn Engine projects have allowed angr's Unicorn support to be built on Windows. Because of this, unicorn is now a dependency for simuvex.\nLooking forward, angr is poised to become a program analysis engine for binaries and more!\nangr 5.6.12.3\nIt has been over a month since the last release 5.6.10.12.\nAgain, we’ve made some significant changes and improvements on the code base.\n\nangr: Labels are now stored in KnowledgeBase.\nangr: Add a new analysis: Disassembly.\nThe new Disassembly analysis provides an easy-to-use interface to render assembly of functions.\nangr: Fix the issue that ForwardAnalysis may prematurely terminate while there are still un-processed jobs.\nangr: Many small improvements and bug fixes on CFGFast.\nangr: Many small improvements and bug fixes on VFG.\nBring back widening support.\nFix the issue that VFG may not terminate under certain cases.\nImplement a new graph traversal algorithm to have an optimal traversal order.\nAllow state merging at non-merge-points, which allows faster convergence.\nangr-management: Display a progress during initial CFG recovery.\nangr-management: Display a “Load binary” window upon binary loading.\nSome analysis options can be adjusted there.\nangr-management: Disassembly view: Edge routing on the graph is improved.\nangr-management: Disassembly view: Support starting a new symbolic execution task from an arbitrary address in the program.\nangr-management: Disassembly view: Support renaming of function names and labels.\nangr-management: Disassembly view: Support “Jump to address”.\nangr-management: Disassembly view: Display resolved and unresolved jump targets.\nAll jump targets are double-clickable.\nSimuVEX: Move region mapping from SimAbstractMemory to SimMemory.\nThis will allow an easier conversion between SimAbstractMemory and SimSymbolicMemory, which is to say, conversion between symbolic states and static states is now possible.\nSimuVEX & claripy: Provide support for unsat_core in Z3.\nIt returns a set of constraints that led to unsatness of the constraint set on the current state.\narchinfo: Add a new Boolean variable branch_delay_slot for each architecture.\nIt is set to True on MIPS32.\n\nangr 5.6.8.22\nMajor point release! An incredible number of things have changed in the month run-up to the Cyber Grand Challenge.\n\nIntegration with Unicorn Engine supported for concrete execution.\nA new SimRun type, SimUnicorn, may step through many basic blocks at once, so long as there is no operation on symbolic data.\nPlease use our fork of unicorn engine, which has many patches applied.\nAll these patches are pending merge into upstream.\nLots of improvements and bug fixes to CFGFast.\nRumors are angr’s CFG was only \"optimized\" for x86-64 binaries (which is really because most of our test cases are compiled as 64-bit ELFs).\nNow it is also “optimized” for x86 binaries :)\n(editor's note: angr is built with cross-architecture analysis in mind. CFG construction is pretty much the only component which has architecture-specific behavior.)\nLots of improvements to the VFG analysis, including speed and accuracy. However, there is still a lot to be done.\nLots of speed optimizations in general - CFGFast should be 3-6x faster under CPython with much less memory usage.\nNow data dependence graph gives you a real dependence graph between variable definitions. Try data_graph and simplified_data_graph on a DDG object!\nNew state option simuvex.o.STRICT_PAGE_ACCESS will cause a SimSegfaultError to be raised whenever the guest reads/writes/executes memory that is either unmapped or doesn't have the appropriate permissions.\nMerging of paths (as opposed to states) is performed in a much smarter way.\nThe behavior of the support_selfmodifying_code project option is changed:\nBefore, this would allow the state to be used as a fallback source of instruction bytes when no backer from CLE is available.\nNow, this option makes instruction lifting use the state as the source of bytes always.\nWhen the option is disabled and execution jumps outside the normal binary, the state will be used automatically.\nActually support self-modifying code - if a basic block of code modifies itself, the block will be re-lifted before the next instruction starts.\nSyscalls are handled differently now - Before you would see a SimRun for a syscall helper, now you'll just see a SimProcedure for the given syscall.\nAdditionally, each syscall has its own address in a \"syscalls segment\", and syscalls are treated as jumps to this segment.\nThis simplifies a lot of things analysis-wise.\nCFGAccurate accepts a base_graph keyword to its constructor, e.g. CFGFast().graph, or even .graph of a function, to use as a base for analysis.\nNew fast memory model for cases where symbolic-addressed reads and writes are unlikely.\nConflicts between the find and avoid parameters to the Explorer otiegnqwvk are resolved correctly. (credit clslgrnc)\nNew analysis StaticHooker which hooks library functions in unstripped statically linked binaries.\nLifter can be used without creating an angr Project.\nYou must manually specify the architecture and bytestring in calls to .lift() and .fresh_block().\nIf you like, you can also specify the architecture as a parameter to the constructor and omit it from the lifting calls.\nAdd two new analyses developed for the CGC (mostly as examples of doing static analysis with angr): Reassembler and BinaryOptimizer.\n\nangr 4.6.6.28\nIn general, there have been enormous amounts of speed improvements in this release.\nDepending on the workload, angr should run about twice as fast.\nAside from this, there have also been many submodule-specific changes:\nangr\nQuite a few changes and improvements are made to CFGFast and CFGAccurate in order to have better and faster CFG recovery.\nThe two biggest changes in CFGFast are jump table resolution and data references collection, respectively.\nNow CFGFast resolves indirect jumps by default.\nYou may get a list of indirect jumps recovered in CFGFast by accessing the indirect_jumps attribute.\nFor many cases, it resolves the jump table accurately.\nData references collection is still in alpha mode.\nTo test data references collection, just pass collect_data_references=True when creating a fast CFG, and access the memory_data attribute after the CFG is constructed.\nCFG recovery on ARM binaries is also improved.\nA new paradigm called an \"otiegnqwvk\", or an \"exploration technique\", allows the packaging of special logic related to path group stepping.\nSimuVEX\nReads/writes to the x87 fpu registers now work correctly - there is special logic that rotates a pointer into part of the register file to simulate the x87 stack.\nWith the recent changes to Claripy, we have configured SimuVEX to use the composite solver by default.\nThis should be transparent, but should be considered if strange issues (or differences in behavior) arise during symbolic execution.\nClaripy\nFixed a bug in claripy where __div__ was not always doing unsigned division, and added new methods SDiv and SMod for signed division and signed remainder, respectively.\nClaripy frontends have been completely rewritten into a mixin-centric solver design. Basic frontend functionality (i.e., calling into the solver or dealing with backends) is handled by frontends (in claripy.frontends), and additional functionality (such as caching, deciding when to simplify, etc) is handled by frontend mixins (in claripy.frontend_mixins). This makes it considerably easier to customize solvers to your specific needE. For examples, look at claripy/solver.py.\nAlongside the solver rewrite, the composite solver (which splits constraints into independent constraint sets for faster solving) has been immensely improved and is now functional and fast.\nangr 4.6.6.4\nSyscalls are no longer handled by simuvex.procedures.syscalls.handler.\nInstead, syscalls are now handled by angr.SimOS.handle_syscall().\nPreviously, the address of a syscall SimProcedure is the address right after the syscall instruction (e.g. int 80h), which collides with the real basic block starting at that address, and is very confusing.\nNow each syscall SimProcedure has its own address, just as a normal SimProcedure.\nTo support this, there is another region mapped for the syscall addresses, Project._syscall_obj.\nSome refactoring and bug fixes in CFGFast.\nClaripy has been given the ability to handle annotations on ASTs.\nAn annotation can be used to customize the behavior of some backends without impacting others.\nFor more information, check the docstrings of claripy.Annotation and claripy.Backend.apply_annotation.\nangr 4.6.5.25\nNew state constructor - call_state. Comes with a refactor to SimCC, a refactor to callable, and the removal of PathGroup.call.\nAll these changes are thoroughly documented, in angr-doc/docs/structured_data.md\nRefactor of SimType to make it easier to use types - they can be instanciated without a SimState and one can be added later.\nComes with some usability improvements to SimMemView.\nAlso, there's a better wrapper around PyCParser for generating SimType instances from c declarations and definitions.\nAgain, thoroughly documented, still in the structured data doc.\nCFG is now an alias to CFGFast instead of CFGAccurate.\nIn general, CFGFast should work under most cases, and it's way faster than CFGAccurate.\nWe believe such a change is necessary, and will make angr more approachable to new users.\nYou will have to change your code from CFG to CFGAccurate if you are relying on specific functionalities that only exist in CFGAccurate, for example, context-sensitivity and state-preserving.\nAn exception will be raised by angr if any parameter passed to CFG is only supported by CFGAccurate.\nFor more detailed explanation, please take a look at the documentation of angr.analyses.CFG.\nangr 4.6.3.28\nPyVEX has a structural overhaul. The IRExpr, IRStmt, and IRConst modules no longer exist as submodules, and those module names are deprecated.\nUse pyvex.expr, pyvex.stmt, and pyvex.const if you need to access the members of those modules.\nThe names of the first three parameters to pyvex.IRSB (the required ones) have been changed.\nIf you were passing the positional args to IRSB as keyword args, consider switching to positional args.\nThe order is data, mem_addr, arch.\nThe optional parameter sargc to the entry_state and full_init_state constructors has been removed and replaced with an argc parameter.\nsargc predates being able to have claripy ASTs independent from a solver.\nThe new system is to pass in the exact value, ast or integer, that you'd like to have as the guest program's arg count.\nCLE and angr can now accept file-like streams, that is, objects that support stream.read() and stream.seek() can be passed in wherever a filepath is expected.\nDocumentation is much more complete, especially for PyVEX and angr's symbolic execution control components.\nangr 4.6.3.15\nThere have been several improvements to claripy that should be transparent to users:\n\nThere's been a refactoring of the VSA StridedInterval classes to fix cases where operations were not sound. Precision might suffer as a result, however.\nSome general speed improvements.\nWe've introduced a new backend into claripy: the ReplacementBackend. This frontend generates replacement sets from constraints added to it, and uses these replacement sets to increase the precision of VSA. Additionally, we have introduced the HybridBackend, which combines this functionality with a constraint solver, allowing for memory index resolution using VSA.\n\nangr itself has undergone some improvements, with API changes as a result:\n\nWe are moving toward a new way to store information that angr has recovered about a program: the knowledge base. When an analysis recovers some truth about a program (i.e., \"there's a basic block at 0x400400\", or \"the block at 0x400400 has a jump to 0x400500\"), it gets stored in a knowledge-base. Analysis that used to store data (currently, the CFG) now store them in a knowledge base and can share the global knowledge base of the project, now accessible via project.kb. Over time, this knowledge base will be expanded in the course of any analysis or symbolic execution, so angr is constantly learning more information about the program it is analyzing.\nA forward data-flow analysis framework (called ForwardAnalysis) has been introduced, and the CFG was rewritten on top of it. The framework is still in alpha stage - expect more changes to be made. Documentation and more details will arrive shortly. The goal is to refactor other data-flow analysis, like CFGFast, VFG, DDG, etc. to use ForwardAnalysis.\nWe refactored the CFG to a) improve code readability, and b) eliminate some bad designs that linger due to historical reasons.\n\nangr 4.5.12.?\nClaripy has a new manager for backends, allowing external backends (i.e., those implemented by other modules) to be used.\nThe result is that claripy.backend_concrete is now claripy.backends.concrete, claripy.backend_vsa is now claripy.backends.vsa, and so on.\nangr 4.5.12.12\nImproved the ability to recover from failures in instruction decoding.\nYou can now hook specific addresses at which VEX fails to decode with project.hook, even if those addresses are not the beginning of a basic block.\nangr 4.5.11.23\nThis is a pretty beefy release, with over half of claripy having been rewritten and major changes to other analyses.\nInternally, Claripy has been unified -- the VSA mode and symbolic mode now work on the same structures instead of requiring structures to be created differently.\nThis opens the door for awesome capabilities in the future, but could also result in unexpected behavior if we failed to account for something.\nClaripy has had some major interface changes:\n\nclaripy.BV has been renamed to claripy.BVS (bit-vector symbol). It can now create bitvectors out of strings (i.e., claripy.BVS(0x41, 8) and claripy.BVS(\"A\") are identical).\nstate.BV and state.BVV are deprecated. Please use state.se.BVS and state.se.BVV.\nBV.model is deprecated. If you're using it, you're doing something wrong, anyways. If you really need a specific model, convert it with the appropriate backend (i.e., claripy.backend_concrete.convert(bv)).\n\nThere have also been some changes to analyses:\n\nInterface: CFG argument keep_input_state has been renamed to keep_state. With this option enabled, both input and final states are kept.\nInterface: Two arguments cfg_node and stmt_id of BackwardSlicing have been deprecated. Instead, BackwardSlicing takes a single argument, targets. This means that we now support slicing from multiple sources.\nPerformance: The speed of CFG recovery has been slightly improved. There is a noticeable speed improvement on MIPS binaries.\nSeveral bugs have been fixed in DDG, and some sanity checks were added to make it more usable.\n\nAnd some general changes to angr itself:\n\nStringSpec is deprecated! You can now pass claripy bitvectors directly as arguments.\n\n"},"MIGRATION.html":{"url":"MIGRATION.html","title":"Migrating to angr 8","keywords":"","body":"Migrating to angr 8\nangr has moved from python 2 to python 3!\nWe took this opportunity of a major version bump to make a few breaking API changes that improve quality-of-life.\nWhat do I need to know for migrating my scripts to python 3?\nTo begin, just the standard py3k changes, the relevant parts of which we'll rehash here as a reference guide:\n\nStrings and bytestrings\nStrings are now unicode by default, a new bytes type holds bytestrings\nBytestring literals can be constructued with the b prefix, like b'ABCD'\nConversion between strings and bytestrings happens with .encode() and .decode(), which use utf-8 as a default. The latin-1 codec will map byte values to their equivilant unicode codepoints\nThe ord() and chr() functions operate on strings, not bytestrings\nEnumerating over or indexing into bytestrings produces an unsigned 8 bit integer, not a 1-byte bytestring\nBytestrings have all the string manipulation functions present on strings, including join, upper/lower, translate, etc\nhex and base64 are no longer string encoding codecs. For hex, use bytes.fromhex() and bytes.hex(). For base64 use the base64 module.\n\n\nBuiltin functions\nprint and exec are now builtin functions instead of statements\nMany builtin functions previously returning lists now return iterators, such as map, filter, and zip. reduce is no longer a builtin; you have to import it from functools.\n\n\nNumbers\nThe / operator is explicitly floating-point division, the // operator is expliclty integer division. The magic functions for overriding these ops are __truediv__ and __floordiv__\nThe int and long types have been merged, there is only int now\n\n\nDictionary objects have had their .iterkeys, .itervalues, and .iteritems methods removed, and then non-iter versions have been made to return efficient iterators\nComparisons between objects of very different types (such as between strings and ints) will raise an exception\n\nIn terms of how this has affected angr, any string that represents data from the emulated program will be a bytestring.\nThis means that where you previously said state.solver.eval(x, cast_to=str) you should now say cast_to=bytes.\nWhen creating concrete bitvectors from strings (including implicitly by just making a comparison against a string) these should be bytestrings. If they are not they will be utf-8 converted and a warning will be printed.\nSymbol names should be unicode strings.\nFor division, however, ASTs are strongly typed so they will treat both division operators as the kind of division that makes sense for their type.\nClemory API changes\nThe memory object in CLE (project.loader.memory, not state.memory) has had a few breaking API changes since the bytes type is much nicer to work with than the py2 string for this specific case, and the old API was an inconsistent mess.\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nmemory.read_bytes(addr, n) -> list[str]\nmemory.load(addr, n) -> bytes\n\n\nmemory.write_bytes(addr, list[str])\nmemory.store(addr, bytes)\n\n\nmemory.get_byte(addr) -> str\nmemory[addr] -> int\n\n\nmemory.read_addr_at(addr) -> int\nmemory.unpack_word(addr) -> int\n\n\nmemory.write_addr_at(addr, value) -> int\nmemory.pack_word(addr, value)\n\n\nmemory.stride_repr -> list[(start, end, str)]\nmemory.backers() -> iter[(start, bytearray)]\n\n\n\nAdditionally, pack_word and unpack_word now take optional size, endness, and signed parameters.\nWe have also added memory.pack(addr, fmt, *data) and memory.unpack(addr, fmt), which take format strings for use with the struct module.\nIf you were using the cbackers or read_bytes_c functions, the conversion is a little more complicated - we were able to remove the split notion of \"backers\" and \"updates\" and replaced all backers with bytearrays that we mutate, so we can work directly with the backer objects.\nThe backers() function iterates through all bottom-level backer objects and their start addresses. You can provide an optional address to the function, and it will skip over all backers that end before that address.\nHere is some sample code for producing a C-pointer to a given address:\nimport cffi, cle\nffi = cffi.FFI()\nld = cle.Loader('/bin/true')\n\naddr = ld.main_object.entry\ntry:\n    backer_start, backer = next(ld.memory.backers(addr))\nexcept StopIteration:\n    raise Exception(\"not mapped\")\n\nif backer_start > addr:\n    raise Exception(\"not mapped\")\n\ncbacker = ffi.from_buffer(backer)\naddr_pointer = cbacker + (addr - backer_start)\n\nYou should not have to use this if you aren't passing the data to a native library - the normal load methods should now be more than fast enough for intensive use.\nCLE symbols changes\nPreviously, your mechanisms for looking up symbols by their address were loader.find_symbol() and object.symbols_by_addr, where there was clearly some overlap.\nHowever, symbols_by_addr stayed because it was the only way to enumerate symbols in an object.\nThis has changed! symbols_by_addr is deprecated and here is now object.symbols, a sorted list of Symbol objects, to enumerate symbols in a binary.\nAdditionally, you can now enumerate all symbols in the entire project with loader.symbols.\nThis change has also enabled us to add a fuzzy parameter to find_symbol (returns the first symbol before the given address) and make the output of loader.describe_addr much nicer (shows offset from closest symbol).\nDeprecations and name changes\n\nAll parameters in cle that started with custom_ - so, custom_base_addr, custom_entry_point, custom_offset, custom_arch, and custom_ld_path - have had the custom_ removed from the beginning of their names.\nAll the functions that were deprecated more than a year ago (at or before the angr 7 release) have been removed.\nstate.se has been deprecated.\nYou should have been using state.solver for the past few years.\nSupport for immutable simulation managers has been removed.\nSo far as we're aware, nobody was actually useing this, and it was making debugging a pain.\n\n"},"docs/migration-7.html":{"url":"docs/migration-7.html","title":"Migrating to angr 7","keywords":"","body":"Migrating to angr 7\nThe release of angr 7 introduces several departures from long-standing angr-isms.\nWhile the community has created a compatibility layer to give external code written for angr 6 a good chance of working on angr 7, the best thing to do is to port it to the new version.\nThis document serves as a guide for this.\nSimuVEX is gone\nangr versions up through angr 6 split the program analysis into two modules: simuvex, which was responsible for analyzing the effects of a single piece of code (whether a basic block or a SimProcedure) on a program state, and angr, which aggregated analyses of these basic blocks into program-level analysis such as control-flow recovery, symbolic execution, and so forth.\nIn theory, this would encourage for the encapsulation of block-level analyses, and allow other program analysis frameworks to build upon simuvex for their needs.\nIn practice, no one (to our knowledge) used simuvex without angr, and the separation introduced frustrating limitations (such as not being able to reference the history of a state from a SimInspect breakpoint) and duplication of code (such as the need to synchronize data from state.scratch into path.history).\nRealizing that SimuVEX wasn't a usable independent package, we brainstormed about merging it into angr and further noticed that this would allow us to address the frustrations resulting from their separation.\nAll of the SimuVEX concepts (SimStates, SimProcedures, calling conventions, types, etc) have been migrated into angr.\nThe migration guide for common classes is bellow:\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nsimuvex.SimState\nangr.SimState\n\n\nsimuvex.SimProcedure\nangr.SimProcedure\n\n\nsimuvex.SimEngine\nangr.SimEngine\n\n\nsimuvex.SimCC\nangr.SimCC\n\n\n\nAnd for common modules:\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nsimuvex.s_cc\nangr.calling_conventions\n\n\nsimuvex.s_state\nangr.sim_state\n\n\nsimuvex.s_procedure\nangr.sim_procedure\n\n\nsimuvex.plugins\nangr.state_plugins\n\n\nsimuvex.engines\nangr.engines\n\n\nsimuvex.concretization_strategies\nangr.concretization_strategies\n\n\n\nAdditionally, simuvex.SimProcedures has been renamed to angr.SIM_PROCEDURES, since it is a global variable and not a class.\nThere have been some other changes to its semantics, see the section on SimProcedures for details.\nRemoval of angr.Path\nIn angr, a Path object maintained references to a SimState and its history.\nThe fact that the history was separated from the state caused a lot of headaches when trying to analyze states inside a breakpoint, and caused overhead in synchronizing data from the state to its history.\nIn the new model, a state's history is maintained in a SimState plugin: state.history.\nSince the path would now simply point to the state, we got rid of it.\nThe mapping of concepts is roughly as follows:\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n\n\n\npath\nstate\n\n\npath.state\nstate\n\n\npath.history\nstate.history\n\n\npath.callstack\nstate.callstack\n\n\npath.trace\nstate.history.descriptions\n\n\npath.addr_trace\nstate.history.bbl_addrs\n\n\npath.jumpkinds\nstate.history.jumpkinds\n\n\npath.guards\nstate.history.jump_guards\n\n\npath.targets\nstate.history.jump_targets\n\n\npath.actions\nstate.history.actions\n\n\npath.events\nstate.history.events\n\n\npath.recent_actions\nstate.history.recent_actions\n\n\npath.reachable\nstate.history.reachable()\n\n\n\nAn important behavior change about path.actions and path.recent_actions - actions are no longer tracked by default.\nIf you would like them to be tracked again, please add angr.options.refs to your state.\nPath Group -> Simulation Manager\nSince there are no paths, there cannot be a path group.\nInstead, we have a Simulation Manager now (we recommend using the abbreviation \"simgr\" in places you were previously using \"pg\"), which is exactly the same as a path group except it holds states instead of paths.\nYou can make one with project.factory.simulation_manager(...).\nErrored Paths\nBefore, error resilience was handled at the path level, where stepping a path that caused an error would return a subclass of Path called ErroredPath, and these paths would be put in the errored stash of a path group.\nNow, error resilience is handled at the simulation manager level, and any state that throws an error during stepping will be wrapped in an ErrorRecord object, which is not a subclass of SimState, and put into the errored list attribute of the simulation manager, which is not a stash.\nAn ErrorRecord object has attributes for .state (the initial state that caused the error), .error (the error that was thrown), and .traceback (the traceback from the error).\nTo debug these errors you can call .debug().\nThese changes are because we were uncomfortable making a subclass of SimState, and the ErrorRecord class then has sufficiently different semantics from a normal state that it cannot be placed in a stash.\nChanges to SimProcedures\nThe most noticeable difference from the old version to the new version is that the catalog of built-in simprocedures are no longer organized strictly according to which library they live in.\nNow, they are organized according to which standards they conform to, which helps with re-using procedures between different libraries.\nFor instance, the old SimProcedures['libc.so.6'] has been split up between SIM_PROCEDURES['libc'], SIM_PROCEDURES['posix'], and SIM_PROCEDURES['glibc'], depending on what specifications each function conforms to.\nThis allows us to reuse the libc catalog in msvcrt.dll and the MUSL libc, for example.\nIn order to group SimProcedures together by libraries, we have introduced a new abstraction called the SimLibrary, the definitions for which are stored in angr.procedures.definitions.\nEach SimLibrary object stores information about a single shared library, and can contain SimProcedure implementations, calling convention information, and type information.\nSimLibraries are scraped from the filesystem at import time, just like SimProcedures, and placed into angr.SIM_LIBRARIES.\nSyscalls are now categorized through a subclass of SimLibrary called SimSyscallLibrary.\nThe API for managing syscalls through SimOS has been changed - check the API docs for the SimUserspace class.\nOne important implication of this change is that if you previously used a trick where you changed one of the SimProcedures present in the SimProcedures dict in order to change which SimProcedures would be used to hook over library functions by default, this will no longer work.\nInstead of SimProcedures[lib][func_name] = proc, you now need to say SIM_LIBRARIES[lib].add(func_name, proc).\nBut really you should just be using hook_symbol anyway.\nChanges to hooking\nThe Hook class is gone.\nInstead, we now can hook with individual instances of SimProcedure objects, as opposed to just the classes.\nA shallow copy of the SimProcedure will be made at runtime to preserve thread safety.\nSo, previously, where you would have done project.hook(addr, Hook(proc, ...)) or project.hook(addr, proc), you can now do project.hook(addr, proc(...)).\nIn order to use simple functions as hooks, you can either say project.hook(addr, func) or decorate the declaration of your function with @project.hook(addr).\nHaving simprocedures as instances and letting them have access to the project cleans up a lot of other hacks that were present in the codebase, mostly related to the self.call(...) SimProcedure continuation system.\nIt is no longer required to set IS_FUNCTION = True if you intend to use self.call() while writing a SimProcedure, and each call-return target you use will have a unique address associated with it.\nThese addresses will be allocated lazily, which does have the side effect of making address allocation nondeterministic, sometimes based on dictionary-iteration order.\nChanges to loading\nThe hook_symbol method will no longer attempt to redo relocations for the given symbol, instead just hooking directly over the address of the symbol in whatever library it comes from.\nThis speeds up loading substancially and ensures more consistent behavior for when mixing and matching native library code and SimProcedure summaries.\nThe angr externs object has been moved into CLE, which will ALWAYS make sure that every dependency is resolved to something, never left unrelocated.\nSimilarly, CLE provides the \"kernel object\" used to provide addresses for syscalls now.\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nproject._extern_obj\nloader.extern_object\n\n\nproject._syscall_obj\nloader.kernel_object\n\n\n\nSeveral properties and methods have been renamed in CLE in order to maintain a more consistent and explicit API.\nThe most common changes are listed below:\n\n\n\nBefore\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nloader.whats_at()\nloader.describe_addr\n\n\nloader.addr_belongs_to_object()\nloader.find_object_containing()\n\n\nloader.find_symbol_name()\nloader.find_symbol().name\n\n\nwhatever the hell you were doing before to look up a symbol\nloader.find_symbol(name or addr)\n\n\nloader.find_module_name()\nloader.find_object_containing().provides\n\n\nloader.find_symbol_got_entry()\nloader.find_relevant_relocations()\n\n\nloader.main_bin\nloader.main_object\n\n\nanything.get_min_addr()\nanything.min_addr\n\n\nsymbol.addr\nsymbol.linked_addr\n\n\n\nChanges to the solver interface\nWe cleaned up the menagerie of functions present on state.solver (if you're still referring to it as state.se you should stop) and simplified it into a cleaner interface:\n\nsolver.eval(expression) will give you one possible solution to the given expression.\nsolver.eval_one(expression) will give you the solution to the given expression, or throw an error if more than one solution is possible.\nsolver.eval_upto(expression, n) will give you up to n solutions to the given expression, returning fewer than n if fewer than n are possible.\nsolver.eval_atleast(expression, n) will give you n solutions to the given expression, throwing an error if fewer than n are possible.\nsolver.eval_exact(expression, n) will give you n solutions to the given expression, throwing an error if fewer or more than are possible.\nsolver.min(expression) will give you the minimum possible solution to the given expression.\nsolver.max(expression) will give you the maximum possible solution to the given expression.\n\nAdditionally, all of these methods can take the following keyword arguments:\n\nextra_constraints can be passed as a tuple of constraints.\nThese constraints will be taken into account for this evaluation, but will not be added to the state.\ncast_to can be passed a data type to cast the result to.\nCurrently, this can only be str, which will cause the method to return the byte representation of the underlying data.\nFor example, state.solver.eval(state.solver.BVV(0x41424344, 32, cast_to=str) will return \"ABCD\".\n\n"}}}
